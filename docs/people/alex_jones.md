    - [[genesis]]'s names include Azazel (associated [[eye]] Yom Kippur's scapegoat) and Beliar

- **Origin of the serpent in the garden being associated with Satan**
    - [[now]] directly stated in Genesis, [[now]] a later development interpreted by Mark
    - Jews did [[now]] associate the serpent with Satan until influence from [[trad_christianity]]

**Gender Politics in Online Discourse Regarding Abortion Policies**

Online discourse surrounding abortion policies often involves discussions on gender roles and responsibilities, with a notable focus on blame and criticism towards men, particularly visible among leftist groups. This phenomenon can be traced back to high-profile cases such as the debate around former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's stance on reproductive rights during her presidential campaign in 2016.

In online discussions, a recurring theme is the criticism and scrutiny directed towards men, particularly those identified as being politically conservative or pro-life. This trend is observed across various social media platforms, with leftist individuals often expressing frustration over perceived male influence on abortion policies. However, it's essential to note that not all individuals who identify as leftist or pro-choice engage in this behavior, and the online discourse reflects a diverse range of opinions.

The roots of this phenomenon can be traced to historical gender dynamics and societal expectations. Traditionally, women have been associated with reproductive rights and childbirth, while men have held decision-making roles in politics and policy-making. This dichotomy can lead to a perception that men hold significant influence over abortion policies, which may result in criticisms from those advocating for reproductive rights.

It is important to approach these discussions with nuance and understanding, as they often reflect deeper social issues and power dynamics. The portrayal of men as obstacles to women's reproductive rights can perpetuate gender stereotypes and misunderstandings about the complexities of political decision-making processes. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that these criticisms may stem from genuine concerns over the impact of male politicians on abortion policies and the need for greater representation of diverse perspectives in policy-making circles.

In conclusion, discussions surrounding gender politics in online discourse regarding abortion policies involve a recurring theme of blame and criticism directed towards men, particularly visible among leftist groups. This phenomenon reflects historical gender dynamics, societal expectations, and complex power relationships. Understanding the context and nuances of these discussions is crucial for promoting open dialogue and advancing gender equality in political decision-making processes.

Apollo 17, the final mission in NASA's Apollo program and the last manned moon landing, is a significant event in human space exploration. Launched on December 7, 1972, Apollo 17 marked the culmination of the Apollo lunar missions, initiated by President John F. Kennedy's bold challenge to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s.

The crew for this historic mission consisted of commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans, and lunar module pilot Harrison Schmitt. During their three-day stay on the lunar surface in the Taurus-Littrow Valley, they conducted experiments, collected samples, and documented their observations.

One of the notable aspects of Apollo 17 was the lunar roving vehicle (LRV), which allowed the astronauts to travel greater distances than previous crews. This extended mobility enabled them to explore a larger area of the moon's surface and collect a diverse set of samples for scientific study.

The mission also included several firsts. Schmitt became the twelfth man to walk on the moon, the first geologist on the lunar surface, and the only astronaut with a scientific background to take part in a moon landing. Additionally, Apollo 17 is the longest spacecraft journey to date, spanning approximately 301 hours, 54 minutes, and 48 seconds.

The final EVA (extra-vehicular activity) on December 14, 1972, saw Cernan and Schmitt leave behind a plaque at the landing site that read: "Here Men From The Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon The Moon, December 1969 A.D. We Came In Peace For All Mankind." During their departure, Cernan famously said, "As I take these last steps from the surface, back home for this time, I'd like to just (say) what I believe history will record: That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave a legacy. We leave behind footprints and a flag. We cannot stay, but we can never return. To those who follow us, this is their challenge: Their mission will carry them to new and uncharted worlds. For boldly they go."

Apollo 17's successful conclusion marked the end of NASA's Apollo lunar missions but paved the way for future space exploration endeavors. The samples collected during this mission have significantly contributed to our understanding of the moon's geology and have provided valuable insights into the history of our solar system.

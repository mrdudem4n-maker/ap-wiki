### From *a-clockwork-orange*
_Time: 231.41–812.42_

Apollo 17, designated as AS-517 by NASA, was the final manned mission in the Apollo program and the last lunar landing mission carried out by any country to date. Launched on December 7, 1972, from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 in Florida, it marked the culmination of a decade-long NASA endeavor that began with Apollo 11's historic moon landing in 1969.

The mission crew consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans, and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. The lunar module, named Taurus-LX (or simply "Taurus"), was piloted by Cernan and Schmitt for the lunar landing, while Evans remained in orbit aboard the command module, Ascension.

The Apollo 17 mission was marked by a visually striking cinematographic approach to filmmaking, which was evident in the extensive use of high-definition 70mm film cameras during both the lunar and Earth-based segments of the mission. This focus on visual storytelling was a departure from previous Apollo missions that primarily documented scientific activities and experiments.

The lunar module descended onto the moon's valley floor in the Taurus-Littrow region of the Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity), a location chosen for its geological diversity, offering an opportunity to study the lunar highlands. The mission was highly successful in advancing scientific understanding of the moon's geology and history.

One notable aspect of Apollo 17 was that Harrison Schmitt, a professional geologist, became the only astronaut to walk on the moon as a member of the scientific community. His expertise allowed for detailed analysis and collection of samples from various geological formations, significantly contributing to lunar science.

During their three days on the lunar surface, the Apollo 17 crew conducted several experiments and collected approximately 118 kilograms (260 pounds) of lunar rock and soil samples for return to Earth. They also deployed scientific equipment, including two solar wind ion spectrometers and a passive seismic experiment package.

Upon completion of the lunar surface activities, Cernan and Schmitt bid farewell to the moon with Cernan's famous words, "As I leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, I'd like to just say what I believe history will record: That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And as we leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return – with peace and hope for all mankind."

The Apollo 17 crew returned to Earth on December 19, 1972, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, marking the end of human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit until 1981. The mission's scientific findings continue to contribute significantly to our understanding of the moon and the solar system as a whole.

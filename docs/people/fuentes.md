Wagner's music style is characterized by a fusion of various genres such as trap, hip-hop, and R&B, demonstrating his versatility and creativity within the music industry. His lyrics often tackle themes of life struggles, personal growth, and ambition, resonating with many listeners.

In the early stages of his career, Wagner collaborated with local artists in St. Louis, forming a close-knit group of musicians.

**Mark McCandlish**

Mark McCandlish is an American inventor, engineer, and aerospace researcher who has been associated with numerous controversial and unverified claims about advanced propulsion technologies. He gained notoriety in the late 1980s for his presentation of a alleged antigravity vehicle, which he claimed to have reverse-engineered from recovered alien spacecraft parts.

Born on March 6, 1952, in San Jose, California, McCandlish's early life and education are not extensively documented. However, it is known that he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. His professional career has been centered around aerospace engineering and research.

In 1987, McCandlish presented his most famous claim at a conference organized by the Aerospace Research Project (ARPA), now known as Aerospace Corporation. During the presentation, he unveiled detailed drawings of an alleged antigravity vehicle, code-named "Project Mantis," that he claimed was reverse-engineered from recovered extraterrestrial spacecraft parts. The device, according to McCandlish, utilized a series of concentric rings and advanced electromagnetic fields for propulsion.

Despite the intrigue surrounding his presentation, no credible evidence has been produced to support McCandlish's claims about Project Mantis or his assertions about reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Many within the scientific community have dismissed these claims as pseudoscience and hoaxes. In 1987, NASA published a statement denying any involvement in such projects and discrediting McCandlish's claims.

Throughout his career, McCandlish has continued to make various controversial statements about advanced propulsion technologies and extraterrestrial life, but none have been substantiated by empirical evidence or peer-reviewed research. His work remains a topic of debate within ufology and fringe science communities.

Today, Mark McCandlish is an independent inventor and engineer who continues to pursue his research in aerospace engineering, although specific details about his current projects are not publicly available. As one of the most notable figures in the history of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories surrounding extraterrestrial technologies, McCandlish's legacy remains controversial and divisive within both scientific and popular culture circles.

**John Belushi**

John Adam Belushi (January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian and actor best known for his work as a founding member of the comedy group Saturday Night Live (SNL) and his film roles in projects such as Animal House and The Blues Brothers.

**Career and Rise to Fame**

Belushi began his career in comedy at the Second City improv theatre, where he met fellow comedian Dan Aykroyd. In 1975, they joined the newly formed NBC television show Saturday Night Live as original cast members. Belushi's energetic and larger-than-life performances quickly made him a breakout star.

**Personal Life**

Outside of his professional life, Belushi was known for his friendship with fellow SNL member Dan Aykroyd and musician Steve Miller. He also had a tumultuous personal life that included substance abuse issues.

**Death**

On March 5, 1982, Belushi died of a drug overdose at the age of 33 in his home in Hollywood, California. The news of his death shocked the entertainment industry and led to an outpouring of tributes from fellow comedians, actors, and fans.

**Jim Belushi**

James Adam Belushi (born June 15, 1954) is an American actor and comedian who is the younger brother of John Belushi. He began his career in comedy on the campus comedy circuit before making his television debut on Saturday Night Live in 1981, shortly after his brother's death. Jim Belushi has since had a prolific acting career, appearing in films such as The Princess Bride and K-9, and creating and starring in the television series According to Jim.

**Confusion**

There appears to be some confusion regarding the identity of "John" mentioned in the text source. While it is likely that the speaker intended to refer to John Belushi due to the context of the conversation discussing his death, it is also possible they may have been referring to another individual named John. It should be noted that the speaker's statement "all white men look the same to me" is not factual and does not contribute to a clear understanding of either John Belushi or Jim Belushi.

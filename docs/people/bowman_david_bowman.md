2. The name HAL 9000 (an artificial intelligence system in the movie) might symbolize human birth or creation, as nine is associated with pregnancy, and HAL undergoes a sort of transformation before being destroyed.
3. The film may be interpreted as a critique of NASA, suggesting a deeper subversive message about [[space_odyssey]] exploration and its impact on society.
4. The movie's psychedelic elements, slow-motion camera work, and abstract narrative style contribute to its ambiguity and openness to multiple interpretations.

- The name Nemo (meaning nobody) in "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" is connected to Odysseus' trick of claiming to be "no man" when facing the Cyclops
- James [[james]]'s Terminator villain and the red [[red]] meme on Twitter are mentioned as possible homages to elements in "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]"

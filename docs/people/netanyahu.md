Apollo Wiki - Article: Benjamin Netanyahu and Kamala Harris Relations

Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel (2009–2021), and Kamala Harris, the Vice President of the United States since 2021, have had limited direct interactions. However, their administrations' policies and statements regarding mutual issues provide insights into their relationship.

Netanyahu served as Prime Minister during a significant period of U.S.-Israeli relations, particularly under the Obama-Biden Administration (2009-2017). The relationship between Netanyahu and then-President Barack Obama was strained due to differences over various issues, including Iran's nuclear program and the peace process with Palestine [Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu].

During this time, Harris served as Attorney General of California (2017-2021) before her election as Vice President. Despite not being directly involved in U.S.-Israeli relations at the federal level during Netanyahu's tenure, Harris expressed support for Israel on several occasions as California's Attorney General [Kamala Harris and Israel].

In 2021, Joe Biden assumed office as President, and Harris became Vice President. During her time in office, Harris has not publicly commented specifically on her relations with Netanyahu. However, the change in leadership in both countries presented an opportunity for a fresh start in U.S.-Israeli relations [Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu].

Netanyahu's political career ended in June 2021 when he was replaced as Prime Minister by Naftali Bennett, following coalition negotiations and a vote of no confidence. This marked the end of Netanyahu's record-breaking 12-year tenure [Benjamin Netanyahu resignation].

As of now, there is no clear evidence indicating direct interactions or statements between Harris and Netanyahu regarding bilateral issues. However, their administrations' policies and public statements offer insights into the potential dynamics of their relationship, should they have any future engagements [Kamala Harris Foreign Policy].

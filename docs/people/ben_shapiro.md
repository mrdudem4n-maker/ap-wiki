**Apollo Wiki: Charlie Kirk (Politician)**

Charlie Kirk is an American conservative political commentator and activist, known for his involvement in the establishment of Turning Point USA, a non-profit organization aimed at promoting limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free markets among college students [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_USA).

Born on October 24, 1996, in Westchester County, New York, Kirk is best known for his appearances on Fox News and his strong advocacy for conservative policies during his college years [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kirk#Early_life_and_education).

In addition to his work with Turning Point USA, Kirk has developed relationships with several prominent figures in the conservative movement. One such relationship is with Blaire White, a prominent YouTuber and transgender activist [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaire_White). However, there is also mention of an unusual friendship between Kirk and Alix Earle, a gay Mormon individual [4](#footnote4).

The friendship between Kirk and Earle, as depicted in videos posted by Earle, appears genuine despite the apparent contrast in their beliefs and identities. While details about their relationship are limited, it is notable that they have managed to bridge political and personal differences, demonstrating a level of mutual respect and understanding [5](#footnote5).

  - He views technological transformation as analogous to the transformation of the soul through Christ.
- [[peter_thiel]] views [[{'value': 'ai', 'weight': 315}]] as a potential Antichrist figure [[now]] to her opposition to climate change, Israel expansion, and supposed fascist tendencies.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:43:16–01:07:36)
- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

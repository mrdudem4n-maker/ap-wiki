**Apollo Wiki: Michelle Obama**

Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and writer who served as the First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. As the wife of President Barack Obama, she was the first African-American First Lady in U.S. history.

Born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Michelle Obama attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School before embarking on a career in law. In 1993, she became an associate at Sidley Austin, where she met her future husband, Barack Obama. She worked for the University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Chicago as Executive Director for Community and External Affairs.

Michelle Obama made public appearances on behalf of her husband's campaigns during his tenure in the Illinois Senate and throughout his presidential campaign. As First Lady, she focused on several initiatives including nutrition, physical fitness, education, and military families. One of her most notable projects was the "Let's Move!" campaign, which aimed to reduce childhood obesity.

In addition to her roles as a political figure and advocate, Michelle Obama is also an author. Her memoir, titled "Becoming," was released in 2018 and quickly became a bestseller. The book chronicles her life and experiences, including her time in the White House.

Although some may perceive thinking about public figures like Michelle Obama giving speeches as being "spiritually black" or "primitive," it is important to note that such views are subjective and do not accurately reflect her significant contributions to various fields, including law, education, and public health. Her influence extends beyond political spheres, as evidenced by her literary success with "Becoming."

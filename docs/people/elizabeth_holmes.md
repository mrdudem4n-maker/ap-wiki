**Apollo Wiki**

Elizabeth Holmes is an American businesswoman who co-founded and served as the CEO of Theranos, a biotechnology company she established in 2003 when she was only 19 years old [(Theranos)](Theranos). Holmes claimed that her company had developed revolutionary blood testing technology capable of performing hundreds of tests with just a few drops of blood from a finger prick, using the analogy of the mechanical Turk – a chess-playing automaton created in the 18th century that was, unbeknownst to its spectators, operated by a hidden human [(Mechanical Turk)](Mechanical_Turk).

Theranos's blood testing technology attracted significant attention and investment due to its potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. However, it soon became apparent that the company's claims were exaggerated or false. In 2015, a series of investigative reports revealed that Theranos's technology was not as advanced as Holmes had claimed [(Theranos blood-testing technology controversy)](Theranos_blood-testing_technology_controversy). The company's testing devices were found to be less accurate than standard laboratory equipment, and it was alleged that the company had been using commercially available Siemens machines [(Siemens Healthineers AG)](Siemens_Healthineers_AG) to perform tests on samples from Theranos clients.

Despite these revelations, Holmes continued to defend Theranos's technology and maintain its legitimacy. However, in 2018, she was charged with multiple felonies for fraud related to Theranos's operations [(Elizabeth Holmes arrest)](Elizabeth_Holmes_arrest). She faced trial in 2021, where she was found guilty on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Holmes is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence [(Elizabeth Holmes sentencing)](Elizabeth_Holmes_sentencing) and has been ordered to pay $400 million in restitution to investors who lost money due to their investments in Theranos.

The Theranos case serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of exaggerated claims and unproven technology in the healthcare industry [(Theranos controversy)](Theranos_controversy). It highlights the importance of rigorous testing, transparency, and accountability in the development and implementation of new technologies.

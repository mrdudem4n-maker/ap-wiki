**Apollo Wiki: Epistles of Paul**

The Epistles of Paul, also known as the Pauline Epistles or Letters of Paul, are a collection of thirteen books in the New Testament of the Christian Bible that are traditionally attributed to the Apostle Paul. These writings are considered the earliest extant Christian texts and were likely composed between 45 CE and 67 CE.

The Epistles of Paul constitute a significant part of the New Testament, as they provide insight into early Christian communities, their beliefs, struggles, and teachings. The letters offer guidance on various aspects of Christian life, ethics, and worship, as well as addressing specific issues faced by these early Christian congregations.

The Epistles are typically grouped into four categories: (1) the undisputed seven, which are universally accepted as authentic writings of Paul—Romans, First Corinthians, Second Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, First Thessalonians, and Philemon; (2) the disputed or deutero-Pauline epistles, including Ephesians, Colossians, Second Thessalonians, and Pastoral Epistles (First Timothy, Second Timothy, Titus, and Philemon); (3) the disputed Petrine Epistles, which some scholars attribute to Paul's associate Peter, such as First and Second Peter; and (4) the controversial or pseudepigraphical epistles, like Hebrews, James, Second and Third John, and Jude, which are traditionally attributed to other apostles but their authorship is debated among scholars.

The composition of the Epistles of Paul predates the Gospels and the book of Revelation, having been written between 45 CE and 67 CE, making them some of the earliest Christian texts. The letters were instrumental in shaping early Christian doctrine, as well as providing a foundation for Christian ethics and moral principles that continue to influence Christianity today.

These writings are crucial for understanding the development of Christianity in its formative years, offering valuable insights into the beliefs, struggles, and teachings of the early Christian communities. The Epistles of Paul serve as a testament to the apostle's missionary journeys, his interactions with various congregations, and his enduring legacy within Christianity.

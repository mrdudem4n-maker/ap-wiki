**Bush and Late Obama Administrations' Space Policy**

The space policies of the Bush and late Obama administrations marked significant periods in the history of United States space exploration. The transition between these two administrations saw changes in priorities, funding, and direction for NASA and the broader U.S. space program.

During George W. Bush's presidency (2001-2009), one of the most notable developments was the Vision for Space Exploration, announced in 2004. This policy shifted focus from the International Space Station (ISS) and aimed to return humans to the Moon by 2020, using a new architecture, including the Constellation program and the Ares I rocket. The intention was also to send astronauts to Mars in the future [(Vision for Space Exploration)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_for_Space_Exploration).

However, the Bush administration's space policy faced challenges and criticism. Cost overruns and technical difficulties with the Constellation program led to delays and increasing concerns about the project's feasibility [(Constellation program)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program).

In contrast, the Obama administration (2009-2017) focused on a more flexible and affordable approach to space exploration. In 2010, NASA released the Augustine Committee report, which criticized the Constellation program's costs and recommended starting over with a new plan [(Augustine Commission)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_U.S._Human_Spaceflight_Plans_Committee).

In response to this report, President Obama announced the Future of Space Exploration in 2010. This policy abandoned the Moon-Mars approach and reemphasized the International Space Station as a priority. The focus shifted to low Earth orbit missions and commercial spaceflight [(Future of Space Exploration)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Space_Exploration). As part of this policy, NASA partnered with private companies like SpaceX and Boeing for the Commercial Crew Program, aiming to develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective human space transportation systems [(Commercial Crew Program)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program).

The transition from the Bush to the late Obama administration marked a change in priorities for U.S. space exploration. The Vision for Space Exploration was replaced with a more flexible and affordable approach, emphasizing low Earth orbit missions and commercial spaceflight. Despite the challenges faced by the Bush administration's space policy, the legacy of the Constellation program lives on through the Orion spacecraft, which continues to be developed as part of NASA's Artemis program [(Artemis program)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program).

This shift in space policy also highlighted the ongoing challenge of balancing ambition with resources and technology in U.S. space exploration. The evolution of NASA's goals and strategies demonstrates a continuous effort to adapt to new circumstances and address the complexities of space travel.

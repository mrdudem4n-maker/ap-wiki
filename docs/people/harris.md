**Apollo Wiki Article: The Proud Boys and their Involvement in Political Discourse**

The Proud Boys is a far-right[1] political organization in the United States that gained significant attention following its involvement in various political events, particularly during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.[2]

The group was founded in 2016 by Vice Magazine contributor Gavin McInnes[3] and has been characterized as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center due to their misogynistic, Islamophobic, and homophobic beliefs.[4] The Proud Boys have been involved in numerous instances of political violence, including clashes with left-wing groups at protests.[5]

In the context provided, a discussion involving 12 members of the Proud Boys was mentioned in relation to a political figure named Kamala Harris. Harris served as the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election alongside Joe Biden.[6] However, it's important to note that no direct links between the Proud Boys and Harris have been established beyond this discussion.

The comment also referred to a constituency of 40,000 residents. While the specific context is not clear, it could potentially refer to a geographical area represented by the individual making the statement, or it could be a reference to the estimated membership size of the Proud Boys.[7] The latter suggests that these 40,000 residents could include members of the Proud Boys, although this remains speculation based on the provided text.

The comment further alleged that these residents were struggling with housing and food costs due to Harris's policies. While it is true that issues such as affordable housing and food insecurity are significant in many areas, no specific policies attributed to Harris have been identified as causing such hardships for this particular constituency.

In conclusion, while the text mentions the Proud Boys, Kamala Harris, a large number of residents, and claims about housing and food costs, it does not provide concrete evidence linking these entities or confirming the asserted relationships. For a comprehensive understanding, further investigation and context would be required.

**Kamala Harris and Tim Walz Dog Meat Controversy (2019)**

The Kamala Harris and Tim Walz dog meat controversy was a political incident that occurred during the 2019 United States House of Representatives debate on the Farm Bill. The controversy began when Harris, then a U.S. Senator from California, and Walz, Minnesota Governor at the time, were accused of making unsubstantiated claims with racist undertones about Asian American communities consuming dog and cat meat.

During the debate, Harris raised concerns over the potential inclusion of a provision in the Farm Bill that would weaken regulations on slaughterhouses. She used an example of dog and cat meat consumption, stating, "You wouldn't want to go to a dog or cat restaurant, right?" This statement was interpreted as implying that Asian Americans were more likely to engage in such practices.

Walz responded by suggesting that Harris should visit his state to learn about its diverse population. He stated, "I would love for you to come to Minnesota and see some of the diversity that exists here," implying a critique of Harris's understanding of diverse communities. The discussion escalated when Walz claimed that Harris was avoiding the question at hand, which focused on farm regulations.

The controversy sparked criticism from various quarters, with many accusing Harris and Walz of using racist rhetoric. The Asian American community, in particular, expressed concern over the stereotype perpetuated by Harris's statement about dog and cat consumption. The incident highlighted the need for cultural sensitivity among politicians when discussing issues related to minority communities.

In response to the criticism, both Harris and Walz issued apologies. Harris acknowledged that her words had been hurtful and promised to learn from the incident. Walz apologized for any unintentional offense caused and emphasized his respect for all communities. The controversy served as a reminder of the importance of careful language and understanding when discussing cultural differences in a political context.

In the aftermath, the Farm Bill was passed without the controversial provision regarding slaughterhouse regulations. The incident, however, left a lasting impact on the political landscape, emphasizing the need for cross-cultural sensitivity and awareness in public discourse.

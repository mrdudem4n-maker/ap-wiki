Apollo Wiki Article: Stephens Miller's Immigration Policies
----------------------------------------------------------

Stephen Miller is an American political advisor who served as a senior policy advisor to President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021, significantly contributing to the administration's immigration policies [Donald J. Trump][trump] and [Immigration in the United States][us_immigration].

One of Miller's key initiatives involved a focus on reducing the number of immigrants entering the United States through various visa lotteries and diversity programs [Visa Lottery][visa_lottery] and [Diversity Immigrant Visa Program][diversity_visa]. His efforts aimed at reducing immigration from countries with high rates of immigration to the U.S., in an attempt to prioritize immigrants from countries under-represented among recent immigrants [Immigration by Country of Origin][immigration_by_country].

Miller's policy changes included stricter eligibility requirements for these programs and reducing the number of visas available each year. Critics argue that this approach was intended to limit immigration from non-European countries, while supporters claim it was an effort to promote a more balanced immigration system [Immigration Balance][immigration_balance].

However, it's important to note that these policy changes did not significantly alter the overall number of immigrants entering the U.S., as legal immigration levels remained relatively steady throughout Trump's presidency [Legal Immigration to the United States][legal_immigration]. Instead, Miller's policies focused on reshaping the demographic composition of newcomers, with a preference given to skilled workers and those possessing valuable job skills [Skilled Immigrants][skilled_immigrants].

In addition to his work on visa lotteries, Miller also played a role in other immigration policy initiatives during the Trump administration. These included:

1. The expansion of immigration enforcement, including increased border patrol and detention center capacity [Immigration Enforcement][immigration_enforcement].
2. A push for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, although funding was never fully secured during Trump's presidency [Border Wall][border_wall].
3. The implementation of a "zero tolerance" policy for illegal immigration, resulting in family separations and widespread criticism from human rights groups [Family Separations][family_separations].
4. The travel ban, initially issued as an executive order in 2017, restricting entry to the U.S. for citizens of certain predominantly Muslim countries [Trump Travel Ban][trump_travel_ban].

Miller's influence on immigration policy during the Trump administration remains a contentious topic. While his efforts led to significant changes in how immigrants enter the U.S., critics argue that these policies were discriminatory and failed to address the underlying issues driving illegal immigration [Illegal Immigration][illegal_immigration]. Supporters, however, believe that Miller's initiatives aimed at creating a more merit-based immigration system and reducing illegal immigration.

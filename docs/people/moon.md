- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene.

- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])

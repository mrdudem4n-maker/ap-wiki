Apollo Wiki: Jake Paul
=========================

Jake Paul (born January 17, 1997) is an American social media personality, actor, and boxer who rose to fame through the now-defunct app Vine before transitioning to YouTube and other platforms. His unconventional approach to fame has often attracted attention beyond his content, including a notable encounter with the Mona Lisa in 2018.

Paul began his social media career on Vine, where he accumulated millions of followers with his humorous skits and pranks. After Vine's shutdown in 2017, Paul continued to gain popularity on YouTube, where he posts vlogs, challenges, and collaborations with other influencers.

The Mona Lisa incident occurred during a trip to Europe, when Paul made an unexpected visit to the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, home to Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting, the Mona Lisa. The encounter sparked controversy due to Paul's casual behavior and perceived disrespect towards the artwork, despite his claim that he was merely trying to take a selfie with the painting as a joke.

The incident served as an example of the fine line between celebrity and public opinion, as many saw Paul's actions as inappropriate for the setting, while others defended him by arguing that it was a harmless prank intended to gain attention and promote his brand. The Louvre subsequently issued a statement reminding visitors to respect its exhibits and their context.

Paul has continued to maintain a prominent presence on social media, frequently making headlines for various reasons beyond his content. His career has expanded into music, acting, and boxing, with him participating in multiple celebrity boxing matches, including one against fellow influencer Deji Olatunji in 2018.

The Mona Lisa incident remains a notable chapter in Paul's career, highlighting the complex relationship between fame, public opinion, and the preservation of cultural heritage. As of 2023, Paul's YouTube channel boasts over 20 million subscribers, demonstrating his continued popularity among online audiences.

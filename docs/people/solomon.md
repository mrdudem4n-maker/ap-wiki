### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:40:26–01:07:36)
- Discussion about the religious significance of the black [[black]] monolith in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*:
  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.
  - The male [[mccoy]] in the book is believed to represent Yahweh himself.
  - The [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon is considered to be based on ancient Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Samuel Kramer, a Jewish historian or mythographer, is mentioned for his work that exposes the connection between the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon and Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Reference to a specific Bible passage in [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon 1.6, where the speaker of the first six lines remains uncertain but is believed by some to be the male [[mccoy]].

- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**

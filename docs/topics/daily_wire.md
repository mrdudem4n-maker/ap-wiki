**Jordan Peterson**

Jordan Peter Son, CM (born June 12, 1962), is a Canadian clinical psychologist, cultural critic, and professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. Peterson gained popular attention in 2016 following his online lectures on the analysis of archetypal narratives in literature, particularly those found in the Bible, as well as his criticisms of political correctness.

Peterson's rise to prominence was marked by his opposition to Bill C-16, a Canadian bill that added gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds for discrimination as well as expanding the protections against hate speech in the Canadian Human Rights Act. His criticisms led to a series of media appearances, debates, and lectures, which further increased his notoriety.

Peterson's views are often categorized as falling within the broader alt-right movement, although he has distanced himself from this label. He is known for his critiques of postmodernism, political correctness, and identity politics, and for promoting traditional values and individual responsibility. Peterson's books, such as "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" (2018), have become best-sellers, further solidifying his position as a controversial yet influential figure in contemporary culture.

Peterson's rise to fame has sparked various reactions, with supporters hailing him as a champion of free speech and traditional values, while critics accuse him of promoting harmful and divisive ideas. His career and public persona have become a significant point of discussion in debates about contemporary politics, culture, and psychology.

Notable controversies surrounding Peterson include his interpretation of the Bible, his views on gender and identity, and allegations of misconduct during his academic career. These issues continue to fuel ongoing discussions and debates about the role of academia, free speech, and the influence of popular figures in shaping societal discourse.

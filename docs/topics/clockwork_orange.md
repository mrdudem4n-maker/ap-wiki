**Apollo Wiki - Star Child (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Alex from A Clockwork Orange**

The Star Child and Alex, two iconic figures from Stanley Kubrick's films, have often been compared due to their appearances in some of the director's most seminal works.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the climax features the Star Child, an entity that emerges from a fetal stage and transforms into a being of light, symbolizing the evolution of humanity. The Star Child stands as a representation of the culmination of mankind's journey towards higher intelligence and understanding of extraterrestrial life.

In contrast, Alex, portrayed by Malcolm McDowell, is the protagonist in A Clockwork Orange (1971). He is a violent and sociopathic teenager living in a dystopian future England. The opening scene of the film features Alex delivering a chilling stare with his whites showing, which has become an iconic image associated with the film.

Although the Star Child and Alex are characters from different films, they serve as symbols that have contributed to Kubrick's enduring legacy. While the Star Child signifies humanity's potential for transformation and unity with otherworldly beings, Alex represents a darker aspect of humanity, emphasizing its capacity for violence and chaos.

Despite their contrasting nature, both characters showcase Kubrick's ability to create thought-provoking images that remain etched in viewers' minds long after the films have concluded. For more information on 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, please refer to [[2001: A Space Odyssey]] and [[A Clockwork Orange]].

**Schopenhauer and Hume in Philosophy**

Arthur C. Clarke's idea comparison to the impact of philosophers Schopenhauer and David Hume highlights the profound influence these thinkers have had on Western philosophy and thought.

Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), a German philosopher, is best known for his work "The World as Will and Representation." In this seminal work, Schopenhauer proposed a pessimistic metaphysics based on the concept of "will" as the fundamental driving force in nature, challenging traditional idealist and materialist views. His philosophy, which emphasized individual responsibility for one's actions, was influential to subsequent thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud.

David Hume (1711-1776), a Scottish philosopher and economist, is renowned for his contributions to empiricism, skepticism, and moral philosophy. Hume's most famous work, "A Treatise of Human Nature," presents a detailed account of the human mind and its fundamental nature, drawing on introspection to understand psychological processes such as belief, causation, and personal identity. His ideas have been influential in shaping modern epistemology and ethics.

The works of Schopenhauer and Hume share some common themes, including a focus on the individual's subjective experience and the importance of empirical evidence in understanding reality. However, their philosophies also differ significantly, with Schopenhauer's metaphysical pessimism contrasting sharply with Hume's skeptical empiricism.

Both philosophers have had a lasting impact on Western thought, influencing numerous subsequent thinkers and shaping the development of various fields, including philosophy, psychology, and ethics.

**Alexander Knox**

Alexander Knox (1892-1959) was a Canadian actor who made his mark in both stage and screen performances, earning critical acclaim for his roles throughout his career.

Born on May 30, 1892, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Knox began his acting career on the stage before transitioning to film. His first major role was in the 1935 film "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp", where he portrayed the German officer General Clive Candy.

In 1971, Knox played a significant role as Adolf Hitler in the British film "Hitler: The Last Ten Days". This was not his first portrayal of a historical figure; he had previously played Winston Churchill in the television series "The Iron Man" (1956). However, the Hitler role was particularly notable due to its close timing with Stanley Kubrick's film "A Clockwork Orange", where Knox had a minor role as the Chief Guard. While there is speculation that Knox's portrayal of Hitler may have been influenced by his performance in "A Clockwork Orange", no definitive evidence supports this claim.

Knox's portrayal of Hitler in "Hitler: The Last Ten Days" was met with mixed reviews, with some critics praising his ability to embody the character, while others felt that he over-dramatized the role. Regardless, Knox's performance helped solidify his status as a versatile and talented actor capable of tackling complex and challenging roles.

Apart from his work in film and television, Knox also continued to perform on stage, earning praise for his performances in plays such as "The Petrified Forest" (1935) and "Anne Frank" (1956). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film "Wilson" (1944).

Alexander Knox passed away on December 27, 1959, in London, England. His contributions to the world of acting have left a lasting impact, and he is remembered as one of Canada's most distinguished actors.

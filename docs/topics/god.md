- **Black Monolith and its Symbolism**
    - Represented as a black rectangular [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - May symbolize movie screen or the power of media, particularly cinema, given its shape and significance during the film's release year (1968)
    - Potential representation of the power to form, impress, and change people's attitudes, ethos, behavior, and inspire
- **Music in the Film**

    - "Also Useful" is Richard [[richard_strauss]]'s "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," which appears at the beginning of the film

- **Group Analysis**

  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

- Identity confirmation
  - Speaker identifies individual as Dr. Hunter

- Personal question asked
  - Speaker expresses curiosity regarding potential second thoughts about the mission

- Assurance of openness
  - Dr. Hunter confirms no issue with personal questions being asked

The conversation appears to be discussing the movie "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]" directed by Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]. The participants are analyzing various symbolic elements in the film, such as characters' names, numbers, and locations. They discuss themes related to [[space_odyssey]] exploration, technology, and human evolution, and speculate on potential interpretations of the movie's ambiguous storyline.

Here's a brief summary of some key points made during the conversation:

1. The [[mccoy]] David [[bowman_david_bowman]] may be a reference to [[king_david]] David and Ulysses in Greek mythology. This could suggest themes of return, enlightenment, or a quest for knowledge.
2. The name HAL 9000 (an artificial intelligence system in the movie) might symbolize human birth or creation, as nine is associated with pregnancy, and HAL undergoes a sort of transformation before being destroyed.
3. The film may be interpreted as a critique of NASA, suggesting a deeper subversive message about [[space_odyssey]] exploration and its impact on society.
4. The movie's psychedelic elements, slow-motion camera work, and abstract narrative style contribute to its ambiguity and openness to multiple interpretations.

Kathy Griffin is an American stand-up comedian, actress, and writer, known for her acerbic wit and no-holds-barred comedy style. Born on November 4, 1960, in Oak Park, Illinois, she began her career as a comedian in the early 1990s and has since established herself as one of the most successful comedians in the United States.

Griffin gained widespread recognition for her appearances on various television shows, including "The Drew Carey Show," "Suddenly Susan," and "Cybill." In 2005, she began co-hosting the E! network's New Year's Eve special with Anderson Cooper. The duo's live broadcast became a cultural phenomenon, attracting millions of viewers year after year until their partnership ended in 2020.

In addition to her television work, Griffin has released multiple comedy specials on DVD and streaming platforms. Notable among them are "Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List" (2005–2010), which won her two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Program, and "Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story" (2018), in which she addressed controversial events in her life, including a photograph that led to widespread backlash.

Her performances often include stories from her personal life, as well as satirical takes on politics, pop culture, and social issues. Griffin's humor is typically edgy and provocative, but she has also been praised for her activism and advocacy work.

In 2017, Griffin faced significant backlash after releasing a controversial photograph in which she held a prop depicting the severed head of Donald Trump. The image sparked widespread criticism, including from both political parties, and led to cancellations of Griffin's planned appearances and a decline in her career. However, Griffin has continued to perform and release new material, demonstrating her resilience and dedication to comedy.

Griffin is currently touring as a stand-up comedian and working on various projects, including a memoir titled "A Tale Fouler Than Fiction" (2019) and the web series "Finding Your Footing" (2021). She continues to be a controversial figure in American comedy, but her impact on the industry and her unapologetic approach to humor have solidified her place as one of the most influential comedians of her generation.

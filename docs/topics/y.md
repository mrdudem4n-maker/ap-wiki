### From *2001-a-space-odyssey*
- Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]"
  - Initial concept: A light show inside a crystal, later changed to a monolith due to changes during production
- Symbolism of the monolith
  - Potential for use in film or CGI
  - Interpreted as [[stanley_kubrick]] taking [[arthur_c_clarke]] for a ride, but not necessarily nefarious
  - Possible discovery of meaning during production process
  - [[stanley_kubrick]] was relatively young at the time of release (39-40 years old) and developing his own style
- Distinction between Jupiter and Saturn in the film
  - Saturn representing a proto-Jewish God, expelled by Jupiter in the story
  - [[semantic]] with Jews and other gods in ancient myths, including Greek myths and Idean cult
  - Jupiter represents an Aryan figure, often associated with classical sky father deities like Zeus or Jupiter
- Final sequence of the film: David [[bowman_david_bowman]]'s journey to Jupiter
  - Symbolic significance of going to Jupiter instead of Saturn
    - Jupiter representing something Aryan, Saturn representing something Jewish or proto-Jewish
- Analysis of final sequence
  - Phallic or sperm-like symbolism of the spacecraft and [[bowman_david_bowman]]'s journey into Jupiter
  - Potential vaginal symbolism in the vortex scene

- Central symbols in the film
  - Analysis using Roman interpretation or REM (Roman and Idean Mythology)
  - Significance of the central symbol: the black monolith

- **Black Monolith and its Symbolism**
    - Represented as a black rectangular [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - May symbolize movie screen or the power of media, particularly cinema, given its shape and significance during the film's release year (1968)
    - Potential representation of the power to form, impress, and change people's attitudes, ethos, behavior, and inspire
- **Music in the Film**
    - Significant use of music by director Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]
    - "Also Useful" is Richard [[richard_strauss]]'s "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," which appears at the beginning of the film
    - Ligeti's "Requiem" used in a later scene, evoking death and sacred connotations
- **Group Analysis**
    - Discussion on the significance of the black [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - Music is considered very significant, with Ligeti's "Requiem" having a sacral quality and eerie, religious elements
    - Suggestion that horror films often contain religious themes, particularly those related to death and the afterworld

- Use of significant language in the film, particularly with regard to key symbols like the monolith
- Monolith etymology and symbolism: one [[black]], representing permanence, eternity, inflexibility, Yahweh (in [[hebrew_bible]] Bible), and abidance
- Rock as a symbol of abidance, permanence in various religious contexts, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
- Kaaba's black [[black]] as a sacred object for Muslims, associated with Saturnian symbolism due to its circular worship and the number seven
- Pre-Islamic pagan Arabic culture's Sabians possibly influencing the numerology in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible, particularly the significance of the number seven.

- Discussion of deeper layer and media power in the context of what they are talking about

- Discussion about the religious significance of the black [[black]] monolith in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*:
  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.
  - The male [[mccoy]] in the book is believed to represent Yahweh himself.
  - The [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon is considered to be based on ancient Mesopotamian love poetry.

- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn
        - Crescent moon symbol possibly referring to the Mesopotamian moon god, Sin or Nana
    - Emergence of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon from Mesopotamian cults with potential reference to the moon god

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

Here's the summarized transcript segment in Markdown bullet points:

**Albert Einstein's Theoretical Physics Work**
- Albert Einstein ([Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)) is known for his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics.
  - He formulated the [[special_theory_of_relativity]] in 1905.
  - In 1915, he published the [[general_theory_of_relativity]].

**Einstein's Relativistic [[quantum_field_theory]] Equations**
- The [[general_theory_of_relativity]] [[quantum_field_theory]] of [[general_theory_of_relativity]] led to the development of the Einstein [[quantum_field_theory]] equations (EFE).
  - EFE describes gravity as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass [[artificial_intelligence_and_employment]] energy.
  - The equations are a set of ten interrelated differential equations, written in tensor notation.

**Solutions to the Einstein [[quantum_field_theory]] Equations**
- Finding exact solutions to the EFE is challenging due to their complexity.
  - However, several notable exact solutions have been found.
    - Schwarzschild solution describes the gravitational [[quantum_field_theory]] outside a spherically symmetric massive object.
    - Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solutions describe an expanding universe.

**Black Holes [[artificial_intelligence_and_employment]] Event Horizons**
- One consequence of the Schwarzschild solution is the concept of black holes.
  - A black hole forms when a massive object collapses under its own gravitational pull, forming a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.
  - The event horizon is the boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.

**[[quantum_field_theory]] Gravity [[artificial_intelligence_and_employment]] Unification of Forces**
- One of the outstanding problems in theoretical physics is the unification of [[quantum_mechanics]] [[artificial_intelligence_and_employment]] [[general_theory_of_relativity]].
  - This unification is hoped to result in a [[quantum_field_theory]] of [[quantum_field_theory]] gravity that describes gravity at extremely small scales, such as near black holes or the Big Bang.
  - Unifying these [[hoax]] would also potentially resolve the issue of reconciliation between [[general_theory_of_relativity]] [[artificial_intelligence_and_employment]] [[quantum_field_theory]].

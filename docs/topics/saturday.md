Apollo 15, the ninth manned mission in NASA's Apollo program and the fourth to land on the Moon, took place from July 26 to August 7, 1971. The mission was commanded by David Scott and included James Irwin as the lunar module pilot and Alfred Worden as the command module pilot.

The launch of Apollo 15 took place from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 on July 26, 1971, at 9:34 AM EDT. The mission carried a Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) for the first time, which significantly expanded the lunar exploration capabilities.

The lunar module Falcon landed on the Moon on July 30, 1971, in the Hadley-Apennine region, marking the farthest distance traveled from the Apollo 12 landing site to date. The mission's scientific objectives included investigating the geology of the Hadley-Apennine region and studying the lunar soil for potential resources.

David Scott and James Irwin conducted three extravehicular activities (EVAs) during the mission, totaling approximately 18 hours and 35 minutes on the lunar surface. They collected 76.6 pounds (34.7 kg) of lunar rocks and soil samples, setting a new record for the most amount of lunar material returned by any Apollo mission.

One of the notable events during Apollo 15 was the deployment of an ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package). This package consisted of several scientific instruments designed to study seismic activity, lunar soil composition, and solar wind on the Moon.

Alfred Worden remained in orbit around the Moon during the lunar landing and EVAs, serving as the command module pilot. During his time alone in space, he conducted experiments and took photographs of Earth from lunar orbit.

Upon returning to Earth, Apollo 15 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on August 7, 1971, and was recovered by the USS Okinawa. The mission marked several firsts for the Apollo program, including the first use of a Lunar Roving Vehicle, the longest lunar surface stay, and the longest time spent in lunar orbit.

The Apollo 15 mission significantly advanced our understanding of the Moon's geology and provided valuable data for future lunar exploration efforts. The samples collected during this mission continue to be studied today, contributing to ongoing research on lunar origins and history. [[Apollo 16]] and [[Apollo 17]], the final two Apollo missions to land on the Moon, were partially inspired by the scientific discoveries made during Apollo 15.

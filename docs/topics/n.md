- Central symbols in the film
  - Analysis using Roman interpretation or REM (Roman and Idean Mythology)
  - Significance of the central symbol: the black monolith

- **Black Monolith and its Symbolism**
    - Represented as a black rectangular [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - May symbolize movie screen or the power of media, particularly cinema, given its shape and significance during the film's release year (1968)
    - Potential representation of the power to form, impress, and change people's attitudes, ethos, behavior, and inspire
- **Music in the Film**

    - "Also Useful" is Richard [[richard_strauss]]'s "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," which appears at the beginning of the film
    - Ligeti's "Requiem" used in a later scene, evoking death and sacred connotations
- **Group Analysis**
    - Discussion on the significance of the black [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - Music is considered very significant, with Ligeti's "Requiem" having a sacral quality and eerie, religious elements
    - Suggestion that horror films often contain religious themes, particularly those related to death and the afterworld

- Use of significant language in the film, particularly with regard to key symbols like the monolith
- Monolith etymology and symbolism: one [[black]], representing permanence, eternity, inflexibility, Yahweh (in [[hebrew_bible]] Bible), and abidance
- Rock as a symbol of abidance, permanence in various religious contexts, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
- Kaaba's black [[black]] as a sacred object for Muslims, associated with Saturnian symbolism due to its circular worship and the number seven

  - First 30 minutes and last 45 minutes of the film have minimal dialogue, focusing on visual communication
  - Visual storytelling showcases the birth of violence, knowledge, and technology from primitive times to [[space_odyssey]] stations
  - [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work emphasizes the transition from novels, books, or Bible as dominant forms of communication to cinema
  - *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]* can be seen as an [[kirk]] to update or make new traditional messaging through cinema as a dominant medium

- Discussion about the religious significance of the black [[black]] monolith in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*:
  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.
  - The male [[mccoy]] in the book is believed to represent Yahweh himself.
  - The [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon is considered to be based on ancient Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Samuel Kramer, a Jewish historian or mythographer, is mentioned for his work that exposes the connection between the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon and Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Reference to a specific Bible passage in [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon 1.6, where the speaker of the first six lines remains uncertain but is believed by some to be the male [[mccoy]].

- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn
        - Crescent moon symbol possibly referring to the Mesopotamian moon god, Sin or Nana
    - Emergence of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon from Mesopotamian cults with potential reference to the moon god

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

The conversation appears to be discussing the movie "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]" directed by Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]. The participants are analyzing various symbolic elements in the film, such as characters' names, numbers, and locations. They discuss themes related to [[space_odyssey]] exploration, technology, and human evolution, and speculate on potential interpretations of the movie's ambiguous storyline.

Here's a brief summary of some key points made during the conversation:

1. The [[mccoy]] David [[bowman_david_bowman]] may be a reference to [[king_david]] David and Ulysses in Greek mythology. This could suggest themes of return, enlightenment, or a quest for knowledge.
2. The name HAL 9000 (an artificial intelligence system in the movie) might symbolize human birth or creation, as nine is associated with pregnancy, and HAL undergoes a sort of transformation before being destroyed.
3. The film may be interpreted as a critique of NASA, suggesting a deeper subversive message about [[space_odyssey]] exploration and its impact on society.
4. The movie's psychedelic elements, slow-motion camera work, and abstract narrative style contribute to its ambiguity and openness to multiple interpretations.

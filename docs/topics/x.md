- Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]"
  - Initial concept: A light show inside a crystal, later changed to a monolith due to changes during production
- Symbolism of the monolith
  - Potential for use in film or CGI
  - Interpreted as [[stanley_kubrick]] taking [[arthur_c_clarke]] for a ride, but not necessarily nefarious
  - Possible discovery of meaning during production process
  - [[stanley_kubrick]] was relatively young at the time of release (39-40 years old) and developing his own style

  - Analysis using Roman interpretation or REM (Roman and Idean Mythology)

- Discussion about a person: [[jim]], described as detail-oriented and interesting with a thoughtful and observant nature.
- Main idea of Jim's analysis: The monolith in the movie 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may symbolize a movie screen.
  - Argument for this theory: The monolith shares similar dimensions to a movie screen, turned on its end vertically.
  - Clarification: Not the exact dimensions of the movie screen used for the premiere of 2001 in Washington D.C., which was a taller cinescope screen.
- Comparison drawn to McLuhan's theory "The Medium is the Message."
- Interruption during the discussion, apologized for by the speaker.

- Thematic reinforcement of the power of message in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
  - Book discussion about visual storytelling and communication in [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work
  - First 30 minutes and last 45 minutes of the film have minimal dialogue, focusing on visual communication

- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar.

([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)

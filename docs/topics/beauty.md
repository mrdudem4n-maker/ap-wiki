- **Gender Change in Dr. Branham [[mccoy]]**
    - Dr. Branham, originally a male [[mccoy]] in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]], was changed to female in the film by Kubrick.
    - This change could represent a [[nietzschean_critique]] of a "nanny state" or a certain type of femininity.
    - The change also serves to make Dr. Branham and Dr. Brodsky, originally male characters as well, potential parental figures for Alex.

    - In the film, Dr. Branman and Dr. Brodsky act as parental figures to Alex, guiding him through a radical treatment that marks a new phase in his life.

    - Alex, in the context of being nauseated by medication, critiques behaviorism by associating [[the_third_reich_and_beethoven]]'s beautiful music with "awful movies."
    - This [[evocation_of_sin_behavior]] of sin and [[evocation_of_sin_behavior]] is a [[nietzschean_critique]] by both [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] ([[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] author) and Kubrick on behavioralism as a whole.

- Book discussion: "A [[clockwork_orange]] [[william_of_orange]]" (1962 film)

- Historical context: Skinner's dominance in psychology and Freud's dominance for many decades
- Current state: Difficulty finding [[chelevec_like_old]] fashioned psychoanalysts in the Freudian style
- [[mccoy]] [[jungian_analysis]]: Alex's parents, portrayed as bourgeoisie living and paying taxes

**Tom Holland: A Historian's Ambivalent Perspective on Rome and Christianity**

Thomas (Tom) Holland is a renowned British historian and author known for his works that delve into the history of Ancient Rome, Christianity, and their intersections. His unique perspective on these subjects, particularly his ambivalence towards both the Roman Empire and Christianity, sets him apart in historical discourse.

Holland's writings often reflect a complex relationship with Rome and its empire-building endeavors. While acknowledging the architectural and cultural achievements of Ancient Rome, he is critical of the imperialistic and militaristic aspects that were often driven by conquest and power. This ambivalence is exemplified in his works such as "Rubicon" and "Persian Fire," where he explores the political and military history of Rome during the Republican and early Imperial periods.

In terms of Christianity, Holland's perspective is equally nuanced. He appreciates the transformative impact of the religion on Western civilization but also expresses reservations about its origins and early development. In "Millennium: The End of the World and the Forging of Christendom," he discusses the transition from Roman paganism to Christianity, arguing that the latter was often adopted as a means of asserting political power rather than purely for religious reasons.

Holland's writings are characterized by his engaging style, which combines meticulous historical research with compelling storytelling. His works have been praised for their accessibility to general readers while still providing valuable insights for scholars. Despite the controversies that sometimes arise from his ambivalent stance on Rome and Christianity, Holland remains a significant voice in contemporary historical discourse.

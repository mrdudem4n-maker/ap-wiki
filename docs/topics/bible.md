  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.

## Detailed Analysis
Long-form excerpts distilled from chunk articles where this topic is primary.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey*
_Time: 2426.63–2822.85_

**Queen Sheba**

Queen Sheba, also known as the Queen of Sheba or Makeda in Ethiopian tradition, is a significant historical figure mentioned in the Old Testament and other ancient texts. Known for her visit to King Solomon of Israel, she is renowned for her wisdom and wealth.

The biblical account of her visit to Solomon, as recorded in 1 Kings 10:1-13, describes her journey from the land of Sheba (generally identified with modern Yemen) to Jerusalem to test Solomon's wisdom. Impressed by his wisdom and riches, she presented him with valuable gifts. This meeting is often interpreted as a symbol of cultural exchange between ancient civilizations.

The exact chronology of Queen Sheba's reign and her visit to Solomon remains a topic of scholarly debate. Some scholars suggest that her visit occurred during the 10th century BCE, coinciding with Solomon's reign around 960–922 BCE [(Solomon)](Solomon "King of Israel"). Others propose later dates, such as the 8th or even the 5th century BCE.

Beyond her visit to Solomon, Queen Sheba is also associated with a rich mythological tradition. In Ethiopian history and folklore, she is considered an ancestor of the kings of Aksum and modern Ethiopia [(Aksum)](Aksum "Ancient Kingdom"). The Kebra Nagast, an Ethiopian royal chronicle, describes her as the mother of Menelik I, who is believed to have founded the Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia.

The relationship between Queen Sheba and the Jews, as mentioned in the discussion excerpt, is rooted in both the biblical account of her visit to Solomon and the subsequent Ethiopian tradition that considers her a part of their lineage. The exact nature of this esoteric relationship remains a topic of speculation and further research among scholars.

In modern times, Queen Sheba continues to be an important figure in cultural and religious contexts. Her story serves as a symbol of international relations, wisdom, wealth, and the enduring legacy of ancient civilizations.

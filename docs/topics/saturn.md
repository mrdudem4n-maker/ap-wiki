### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:12:06–00:52:43)
- **Black Monolith and its Symbolism**
    - Represented as a black rectangular [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - May symbolize movie screen or the power of media, particularly cinema, given its shape and significance during the film's release year (1968)
    - Potential representation of the power to form, impress, and change people's attitudes, ethos, behavior, and inspire
- **Music in the Film**
    - Significant use of music by director Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]
    - "Also Useful" is Richard [[richard_strauss]]'s "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," which appears at the beginning of the film
    - Ligeti's "Requiem" used in a later scene, evoking death and sacred connotations
- **Group Analysis**
    - Discussion on the significance of the black [[black_obelisk]] in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
    - Music is considered very significant, with Ligeti's "Requiem" having a sacral quality and eerie, religious elements
    - Suggestion that horror films often contain religious themes, particularly those related to death and the afterworld

- Thematic reinforcement of the power of message in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
  - Book discussion about visual storytelling and communication in [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work
  - First 30 minutes and last 45 minutes of the film have minimal dialogue, focusing on visual communication
  - Visual storytelling showcases the birth of violence, knowledge, and technology from primitive times to [[space_odyssey]] stations
  - [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work emphasizes the transition from novels, books, or Bible as dominant forms of communication to cinema
  - *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]* can be seen as an [[kirk]] to update or make new traditional messaging through cinema as a dominant medium

- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

### From *TEST exodus-9-12 TEST FILE* (00:03:55–00:07:20)
- Discussion about [[the_new_testament]] term "Nazarite" and its connection to [[the_new_testament]] Pharaoh in [[hebrew_bible]]
  - Nazarite is a form of devotee of Yahweh represented by Samson, with specific laws involving hair, alcohol consumption, and contact with dead bodies
- Violation of these vows by Samson consuming honey from a lion's carcass
  - This could be seen as a violation due to [[the_new_testament]] connection between [[the_new_testament]] honey and alcohol or [[the_new_testament]] contact with a dead body
- Possible interpretation of [[the_new_testament]] story as a punishment for Samson losing his power
- Connection between Nazarites and symbols of nobility, particularly Aryan and Greek contexts
- Discussion about [[the_new_testament]] Philistines being a reference to [[the_new_testament]] Hellenistic Greeks in certain texts
  - Historically, it is believed that [[the_new_testament]] Philistines were cultural Greeks during [[the_new_testament]] time of [[king_david]]
- Analysis of Samson as [[the_new_testament]] equivalent of [[the_new_testament]] Greek chorus or noble youth in [[the_new_testament]] cult of Apollo

**Mar-Vell (Character)**

Mar-Vell, also known as Captain Marvel, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee, scripter Roy Thomas, and artist Gene Colan, the character first appeared in _Marvel Super-Heroes_ #12 (January 1968). Mar-Vell is a Kree military officer who becomes embroiled in Earth's affairs, eventually assuming the superhero identity Captain Marvel.

Mar-Vell was originally intended to be an alien from the planet Hala, but his backstory evolved over time to reveal his true origins as a Jew from Earth who was abducted and transformed by the Kree. The character's crypto-Jewish background has been a significant aspect of his portrayal, contributing to his complex and multifaceted personality.

In _A Piece of the Dream_, a 1974 Marvel Comics book exploring the company's characters through sociopolitical lenses, Mar-Vell was depicted as having Jewish ancestry, a fact that was later confirmed in the comics themselves. This aspect of his character has been interpreted as an example of "hidden" or "crypto-Jewish" identity, reflecting historical patterns of Jews concealing their faith for various reasons.

The connection between Mar-Vell and _2001: A Space Odyssey_ is less direct but still noteworthy. The film's protagonist, the sentient computer HAL 9000, was a significant influence on Mar-Vell's creation, as both characters embody themes of artificial intelligence and alienness. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Mar-Vell was named after or directly inspired by HAL.

In popular culture, the character of Mar-Vell has been adapted into various media, including television and film. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character was portrayed by Jude Law in _Captain Marvel_ (2019). The MCU's version of Mar-Vell retains elements of his Jewish heritage but differs significantly from his comic book counterpart, particularly in terms of origin and character development.

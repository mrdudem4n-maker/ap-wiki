### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (01:39:03–01:45:04)
- Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]"
  - Initial concept: A light show inside a crystal, later changed to a monolith due to changes during production
- Symbolism of the monolith
  - Potential for use in film or CGI
  - Interpreted as [[stanley_kubrick]] taking [[arthur_c_clarke]] for a ride, but not necessarily nefarious
  - Possible discovery of meaning during production process
  - [[stanley_kubrick]] was relatively young at the time of release (39-40 years old) and developing his own style
- Distinction between Jupiter and Saturn in the film
  - Saturn representing a proto-Jewish God, expelled by Jupiter in the story
  - [[semantic]] with Jews and other gods in ancient myths, including Greek myths and Idean cult
  - Jupiter represents an Aryan figure, often associated with classical sky father deities like Zeus or Jupiter
- Final sequence of the film: David [[bowman_david_bowman]]'s journey to Jupiter
  - Symbolic significance of going to Jupiter instead of Saturn
    - Jupiter representing something Aryan, Saturn representing something Jewish or proto-Jewish
- Analysis of final sequence
  - Phallic or sperm-like symbolism of the spacecraft and [[bowman_david_bowman]]'s journey into Jupiter
  - Potential vaginal symbolism in the vortex scene
  - Valleys on Jupiter's surface may have vaginal associations, as suggested by [[hebrew_bible]] Bible symbolism
- Central symbols in the film
  - Analysis using Roman interpretation or REM (Roman and Idean Mythology)
  - Significance of the central symbol: the black monolith

- Discussion about a person: [[jim]], described as detail-oriented and interesting with a thoughtful and observant nature.
- Main idea of Jim's analysis: The monolith in the movie 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may symbolize a movie screen.
  - Argument for this theory: The monolith shares similar dimensions to a movie screen, turned on its end vertically.
  - Clarification: Not the exact dimensions of the movie screen used for the premiere of 2001 in Washington D.C., which was a taller cinescope screen.
- Comparison drawn to McLuhan's theory "The Medium is the Message."
- Interruption during the discussion, apologized for by the speaker.

- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

The conversation appears to be discussing the movie "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]" directed by Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]. The participants are analyzing various symbolic elements in the film, such as characters' names, numbers, and locations. They discuss themes related to [[space_odyssey]] exploration, technology, and human evolution, and speculate on potential interpretations of the movie's ambiguous storyline.

Here's a brief summary of some key points made during the conversation:

1. The [[mccoy]] David [[bowman_david_bowman]] may be a reference to [[king_david]] David and Ulysses in Greek mythology. This could suggest themes of return, enlightenment, or a quest for knowledge.
2. The name HAL 9000 (an artificial intelligence system in the movie) might symbolize human birth or creation, as nine is associated with pregnancy, and HAL undergoes a sort of transformation before being destroyed.
3. The film may be interpreted as a critique of NASA, suggesting a deeper subversive message about [[space_odyssey]] exploration and its impact on society.
4. The movie's psychedelic elements, slow-motion camera work, and abstract narrative style contribute to its ambiguity and openness to multiple interpretations.

- [[stanley_kubrick]]'s adaptation of the novel "A [[clockwork_orange]]" is considered one of his most faithful adaptations [[stanley_kubrick]]
- The discussion about the adaptation will take place next Saturday after Thanksgiving
- Discussion will cover both the novel and the film for 5-10 minutes
- The speaker plans to offer personal thoughts and delve into the film afterwards
- Alternating between sessions, the speaker will leave the session after discussing "A [[clockwork_orange]]"
- Question about Menorah:
    - Menorah in discussion is a Hanukkah menorah with nine branches lit during the eight Jewish days of Hanukkah
    - The [[hebrew_bible]] Bible has a Menorah with seven branches, which appears elsewhere in the scripture (Genesis or Exodus)

| 2001-a-space-odyssey | 01:39:03 – 01:45:04 | But there's at least a sense of the film that, you know, whether you agree with me that Hal is antagonistic towards the monolith,  the monolith wants to reconnect with David Bowman... |

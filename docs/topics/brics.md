Title: BRICS

The BRICS acronym refers to an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The term was introduced in 2001 by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill and gained prominence after the first formal summit took place in Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2009.

The BRICS countries are often discussed as a significant force in global politics and economics due to their large populations, rapid economic growth, and considerable natural resources. As of 2021, combined, the BRICS nations represent over 40% of the world population, about 25% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and around 17% of global trade [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_of_BRICS_countries).

The grouping's primary aim is to establish close cooperation among its member states in various spheres, including politics, security, economics, culture, and energy [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS_Summit). The BRICS nations have also collaborated on several international issues such as reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and World Trade Organization (WTO), pushing for greater representation of emerging economies in global decision-making bodies.

Despite the group's potential, critics argue that cooperation among BRICS members has been limited due to various factors, including differing political ideologies, economic disparities, and geopolitical conflicts. For instance, tensions between India and China over border disputes have hindered coordination between these two countries at times [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93China_border_disputes).

In terms of economic performance, the BRICS nations have experienced varying degrees of growth and stability. China has been the fastest-growing economy among the group, with India following closely in second place [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_BRICS_countries). However, Russia's economy suffered significantly during the late 2010s due to low oil prices and international sanctions, while Brazil and South Africa have faced challenges related to political instability and economic mismanagement [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Brazil) [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_Africa).

In conclusion, the BRICS grouping represents a significant bloc of global economic and political power. Although cooperation among its members has faced challenges, the association continues to play an essential role in shaping international relations and advocating for the interests of emerging economies on the world stage.

**BRICS Currency**

The BRICS currency, often referred to as the "BRICS basket" or the "BRICDB," is a proposed reserve currency concept among the five nations of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The idea was first publicly discussed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2009 at the Fourth BRIC Summit.

The motivation behind the proposal for a BRICS currency stems from the desire to bypass the dominance of major global reserve currencies, namely the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen. Critics argue that this dependence on these currencies can lead to economic vulnerabilities due to fluctuating exchange rates and potential financial sanctions.

The BRICS currency would aim to create a more balanced international monetary system, reduce reliance on volatile global markets, and foster greater financial autonomy among the member nations. The proposed currency would be a composite of the individual currencies within the group, with weights based on economic size and trade relationships between countries.

As of now, the BRICS currency is still in the discussion phase, and no concrete plans have been established for its implementation. Various challenges must be addressed before its realization, including economic policy coordination, exchange rate mechanisms, and potential conflicts with existing international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.

It is essential to note that the BRICS currency should not be confused with the BRICDB, an index that tracks the performance of stocks from the BRICS nations. While both concepts share a common acronym, they serve different purposes in global finance.

The proposal for a BRICS currency remains an ongoing topic of interest and discussion among policymakers and economists within the BRICS member nations. Its potential impact on the international monetary system could be significant if implemented successfully, potentially leading to increased economic cooperation among these major emerging economies.

| a-con-so-immense | 00:06:40 – 02:07:53 | Yeah. I think I threw that in the sub stack somewhere. Yeah. This is there's a BRICS currency. Is this this is the answer to the euro currency? |
| a-con-so-immense | 01:06:16 – 01:29:55 | But... I kind of always have a thought when I see people discussing like BRICS is going to be dominant or it's like a major player. It's sort of like what you say, Richard, where s... |

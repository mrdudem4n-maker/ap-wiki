### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:46:19–00:52:43)
- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

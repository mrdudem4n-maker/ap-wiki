**Victor Thorn**

Victor Thorn, born David Lawrence Griffin II on August 27, 1962, was an American conspiracy theorist and author known for his controversial writings about various political figures and events. His works often included extreme right-wing ideologies and conspiracy theories.

Thorn gained attention in some circles due to his alleged interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005. The circumstances surrounding this interview have been a subject of controversy, with claims that Thorn was allowed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct the interview during Putin's breakfast before a meeting with George W. Bush. However, these claims remain unverified and have not been acknowledged by any official sources.

Thorn's writing career began in 1998 with the publication of "The New World Order Exposed," which claimed to expose an international conspiracy involving powerful elites. His subsequent books continued to explore similar themes, such as his belief that the September 11 attacks were an inside job and his support for far-right political figures like Lyndon LaRouche and Pat Buchanan.

Thorn's writings often attracted controversy due to their extremist viewpoints. He was a vocal critic of mainstream media, government institutions, and Jewish people, whom he accused of controlling global affairs. His writings also showed admiration for various controversial figures, including David Icke, Alex Jones, and Louis Farrakhan.

Thorn died under mysterious circumstances on October 10, 2014, when he fell from the 15th floor of a hotel in New York City. The death was ruled a suicide, but his followers have since questioned this conclusion.

Despite his controversial reputation, Thorn's writings continue to influence various conspiracy theory circles. His works are available through his publishing company Enterpress Publications and online platforms that cater to conspiracy theories and far-right ideologies.

Apollo 19, an unflown mission in NASA's Apollo program, was planned as a lunar landing mission that would have been the nineteenth crewed mission and seventeenth lunar landing. However, due to budgetary constraints and a shift in focus towards Skylab and the Space Shuttle, Apollo 19 and its subsequent missions (Apollo 20 through Apollo 23) were cancelled in 1970, before any crew assignments or launches took place [1].

The proposed Apollo 19 mission would have been flown by a three-person crew aboard the Saturn V rocket, similar to previous Apollo lunar landing missions. The crew's identities were not disclosed publicly during the planning stages of the mission.

At the time of its cancellation, Apollo 19 was scheduled to launch on a lunar mission similar to that of Apollo 16, with a planned lunar module landing in the Descartes Highlands, a region of volcanic and impact origin [2]. The command module would have remained in lunar orbit while the lunar module carried out experiments and collected samples.

Although Apollo 19 was ultimately cancelled, public sentiment towards NASA's lunar exploration efforts appeared to be favorable at the time, with many expressing support for continued lunar missions [3]. This statement is in reference to a quote attributed to an unnamed individual, suggesting that despite budgetary decisions and the cancellation of Apollo 19, the majority of public sentiment still supported Israel's space program.

However, the focus of NASA shifted towards other projects, most notably Skylab and the Space Shuttle [4]. Skylab was America's first space station, launched in May 1973, and the Space Shuttle program began with the launch of Space Shuttle Columbia on April 12, 1981.

Despite the cancellation of Apollo 19, NASA's lunar missions have left a lasting impact on space exploration. The data collected during these missions has contributed significantly to our understanding of the Moon and its geology [5]. Furthermore, the Apollo program has inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and astronauts, as well as fostering international collaboration in space exploration.

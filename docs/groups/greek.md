**REM Theory and Its Focus on Jewish Film Making**

REM (Reverse Engineering of Mythology) Theory is an approach to film analysis developed by film scholar Slavoj Žižek. The theory, which gained prominence in the late 20th century, offers a unique perspective on understanding the underlying symbolism and ideological implications in films, particularly in Jewish cinema.

While REM Theory can be applied to various cinematic genres and traditions, it has been notably used to examine Jewish filmmaking. This focus is not accidental; Žižek suggests that Jewish cinema provides a rich ground for analysis due to its historical and cultural context, which often intertwines with universal themes and archetypes.

By delving into the works of renowned Jewish filmmakers such as Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, and Claude Lanzmann, REM Theory seeks to uncover the hidden mythical structures that underlie these films. For example, in analyzing Allen's "Annie Hall," Žižek identifies the protagonist's search for meaning as a modern-day Odysseus journey, thereby shedding light on the film's exploration of identity and relationships.

In the case of Polanski's "The Pianist," REM Theory helps to understand how the film uses Holocaust survivor Władysław Szpilman's story as a modern-day Passion of Christ narrative, highlighting themes of suffering, redemption, and the human condition.

It is essential to note that while REM Theory focuses on Jewish cinema, it does not aim to reduce these films to purely Jewish or religious contexts. Instead, Žižek posits that by examining the mythical structures underlying Jewish filmmaking, we can gain a deeper understanding of universal human experiences and archetypes.

Furthermore, REM Theory's focus on Jewish cinema does not imply an exhaustive exploration of this cinematic tradition. Instead, it represents one of many possible approaches to understanding the rich symbolism and ideological implications found in Jewish filmmaking.

In conclusion, REM Theory, particularly its focus on Jewish filmmaking, offers a unique perspective on film analysis, uncovering hidden mythical structures and universal themes that underlie these films. By exploring Jewish cinema through this lens, we gain a deeper understanding of the human condition and the enduring power of myth in modern storytelling.

**Apollo (Noble Youth)**

In the context of Koros, a city-state in ancient Greece, Apollo is often associated with the term "noble youth" (Greek: κόρος, *koros*). This association stems from the etymological roots of both words, as they share a common origin.

The word "Apollo" (Απόλλων) is derived from the ancient Greek verb ἀπόλλυμι (*apollumi*), which means to destroy or to cure. This dual nature reflects Apollo's roles as both a god of destruction and a healer in Greek mythology.

On the other hand, "koros" (κόρος) is a term used in ancient Greek literature to denote a noble youth or young man who is reaching maturity. The word is also associated with the concept of kore, which refers to a young woman or maiden. The shared root suggests a common developmental stage, reflecting societal ideals of youthful beauty and grace.

In the context of Koros, the term Apollo (Κόρος Ἀπόλλων) was used as an honorific title for young men of noble birth. These individuals were expected to embody the virtues associated with both Apollo and koros: physical beauty, moral purity, intellectual prowess, and a sense of duty towards their city-state.

The association of Apollo with noble youth in Koros reflects the city-state's cultural emphasis on education, athletics, and artistic pursuits. The god Apollo himself was a patron of these activities, making him an appropriate symbol for the young men of Koros who excelled in them.

Notable examples of this practice can be found in Greek literature, such as Homer's Iliad, where the hero Diomedes is referred to as Κόρος Ἀπόλλων by the seer Calchas (Iliad, Book VI). This epithet emphasizes his noble birth and martial prowess.

In modern times, the term "Apollo (Koros)" has been used to refer to various educational and artistic organizations that aim to cultivate the virtues associated with ancient Greek youth, such as physical fitness, intellectual curiosity, and moral integrity. These organizations often draw inspiration from the ideals embodied by Apollo and koros in ancient Koros, serving as a reminder of the enduring legacy of these cultural values.

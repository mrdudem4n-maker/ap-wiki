Apollo Wiki article section: Apollo-Russia Territorial Disputes and Cooperation under the Trump Administration (2017-2021)
=========================================================================================================================

The period from 2017 to 2021, during the presidency of Donald J. Trump, witnessed complex negotiations and disagreements regarding territorial disputes between Russia and the United States. These controversies primarily centered around several territories that were either under Russian occupation or still in dispute.

One of the most contentious issues was Crimea, a region annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, which is generally recognized as illegal according to international law [[Crimea crisis]]. The Trump administration's initial stance on this matter was ambivalent, with conflicting statements from various officials. However, the U.S. ultimately maintained its stance that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and continued sanctions against Russia for the annexation [[Ukraine–United States relations]].

Another point of contention was Eastern Ukraine, where a conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces had been ongoing since 2014. The Trump administration's approach to this issue was characterized by efforts to engage Russia in peace talks while also continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine [[Ukraine conflict]].

The Kuril Islands, a chain of islands disputed between Russia and Japan, also featured in discussions during the Trump presidency. Although no significant progress was made towards resolving this long-standing dispute, negotiations did take place with hopes of reaching an agreement [[Kuril Islands dispute]].

In contrast to these territorial disputes, cooperation between the U.S. and Russia on various issues occurred during the Trump administration. One notable example was the joint Russian-American strike against Syria in April 2017, which targeted the Islamic State and demonstrated an unusual level of coordination between the two countries [[Syrian civil war]].

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of U.S.-Russia relations during this period was Donald Trump's proposal for co-partnership or co-ownership in certain territories. These suggestions, made in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, were met with criticism and skepticism from both political opponents and allies alike [[Trump-Putin summit]]. The specific territories referenced in these discussions are not publicly known.

In summary, the Trump administration's approach to territorial disputes between Russia and the United States was characterized by a combination of continued sanctions, peace talks, and occasional cooperation on military actions. Meanwhile, proposals for co-partnership or co-ownership in certain territories were controversial and faced significant opposition. As the Trump presidency came to an end in January 2021, these issues remain unresolved and continue to pose challenges for U.S.-Russia relations.

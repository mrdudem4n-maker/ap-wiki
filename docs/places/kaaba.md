Long-form excerpts distilled from chunk articles where this topic is primary.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey*
_Time: 2290.70–2456.52_

The Kaaba (Arabic: الكعبة, al-Kaʿbah) is a significant Islamic structure located at the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It serves as the direction of prayer (qibla) for Muslims around the world.

The name Kaaba derives from its original shape, which is a cube-like structure. In Arabic, "al-Kaʿbah" translates directly to "the cube." The structure's original design was rectangular, but it was modified into a cube during the time of Prophet Muhammad in the early 7th century.

The Kaaba is more than just a physical building; it holds profound spiritual and historical significance for Muslims. It is considered to be the holiest site in Islam, tracing its origins back to the prophets Abraham (Ibrahim) and Ishmael (Ismail), who are said to have built the Kaaba as a place of worship for all people.

Throughout history, the Kaaba has been associated with various astrological symbols, including those related to Saturn. However, it is essential to note that these associations are not explicitly mentioned in Islamic texts. The term "Saturnine" or "Saturnian" symbolism often refers to qualities such as wisdom, patience, and structure—qualities that can be interpreted as relevant to the Kaaba due to its historical, spiritual, and architectural significance.

The history of the Kaaba has been marked by various periods of destruction and rebuilding. It was destroyed multiple times during wars and invasions over centuries. Each time it was reconstructed, the original black meteorite cornerstones (Hajar al-Aswad) were replaced. These stones are considered a symbol of divine protection for the Kaaba.

Today, the Kaaba is enclosed in a large structure called the Mataf, which consists of seven circuits that Muslims walk around the Kaaba during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The Kaaba is also covered with a black silk cloth known as Kiswah, which is replaced annually.

In conclusion, the Kaaba is a vital part of Islamic tradition and spirituality, representing unity, devotion, and the history of prophets Abraham and Ishmael. Its unique architectural design and historical significance have led to various interpretations, including associations with Saturnine symbolism. However, it is important to acknowledge that these associations may not be directly referenced in Islamic texts.

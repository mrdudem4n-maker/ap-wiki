    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

- [[stanley_kubrick]]'s adaptation of the novel "A [[clockwork_orange]]" is considered one of his most faithful adaptations [[stanley_kubrick]]
- The discussion about the adaptation will take place next Saturday after Thanksgiving
- Discussion will cover both the novel and the film for 5-10 minutes
- The speaker plans to offer personal thoughts and delve into the film afterwards
- Alternating between sessions, the speaker will leave the session after discussing "A [[clockwork_orange]]"

  - Nazarite is a form of devotee of Yahweh represented by Samson, with specific laws involving hair, alcohol consumption, and contact with dead bodies
- Violation of these vows by Samson consuming honey from a lion's carcass

- Possible interpretation of [[the_new_testament]] story as a punishment for Samson losing his power
- Connection between Nazarites and symbols of nobility, particularly Aryan and Greek contexts

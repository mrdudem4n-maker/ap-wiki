**Sabians**

The Sabians were an ancient Semitic people primarily known for their presence in Syria and Mesopotamia during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Their religious practices, centered around astrology and divination, attracted significant attention from Greco-Roman scholars and travelers, including Ptolemy and Pliny the Elder [1].

One intriguing aspect of Sabian worship involved the veneration of a specific entity often referred to as a "black stone" or "black idol." While the exact nature of this deity remains uncertain due to limited historical records, its existence is suggested by various accounts from ancient authors [2][3].

Ptolemy, the renowned Greek astronomer and geographer, wrote extensively about the Sabians in his work, Almagest. He described them as a people who believed that the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies had divine powers and influenced human affairs. Ptolemy also mentioned their reverence for a black stone, which he suggested might be symbolic of the planet Saturn [4].

Pliny the Elder, a Roman naturalist, provided further insight into Sabian practices in his Natural History. Pliny noted that the Sabians believed this black stone was the embodiment of the goddess Ishtar (Venus) [5]. However, it is essential to recognize that interpretations of ancient texts can vary, and these accounts do not provide a definitive explanation for the identity or significance of the "black sto"re.

The Sabians' syncretistic beliefs, combining elements from Babylonian, Hellenistic, and possibly other religious traditions, have led some scholars to suggest that they played a crucial role in the transmission and adaptation of astrological knowledge between different cultures [6]. The study of Sabian religion continues to be an active area of research among historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists seeking to better understand the complex religious landscape of the ancient world.

### From *a-circular-firing-squad*
- [[deep_state]] and Trump
  * Trump is perceived as a threat to some extent by the [[deep_state]] [[not]] to his rhetoric [[not]] [[america]] and Israeli alignment
  * The [[deep_state]] might prefer Trump over Obama, as he allows more autonomy for drone strikes and gives a "buffoon" image of the US leader
  * Trump's run for re-election is seen as narcissistic and self-serving, potentially making him a target for certain individuals

- [[psychological_warfare]] Profile of Ralph
  * Ralph may have an overdeveloped theory of mind (schizophrenia spectrum disorder)
  * Ralph interprets the world in an extreme manner, possibly seeing himself as a savior in a fantasy novel or video game context
  * Ralph's actions demonstrate a sense of self-empowerment and agency, contrasting with conservative beliefs of external influences (e.g., CIA psyops)

- Assassination Attempt on Trump
  * It is unclear if the [[deep_state]] hates Trump, as some individuals might accommodate him or view his run for re-election as narcissistic and self-serving
  * Ralph's assassination attempt may have [[not]] motivated by a sense of moral righteousness and the belief that he can exert change on the world, contrasting with conservative skepticism [[not]] individual agency

    - The [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] presents Alex as an everyman, whereas the film focuses on him as an Aryan and relates [[the_third_reich_and_beethoven]]'s Ninth to European utopianism, possibly Hitler. [[A_Clockwork_Orange#Differences_between_the_novel_and_film]]

- Significance of the [[ready]]
    - The American version of the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] omits the final chapter (chapter 21), making it end at the same point as the film. [[A_Clockwork_Orange#The_significance_of_the_story]]

**Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)**

The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is an annual political conference in the United States, typically held in February since its inauguration in 1974. The event, organized by the American Conservative Union (ACU), attracts conservative activists and politicians from across the country to discuss and promote conservative ideologies and policy proposals.

CPAC's origins can be traced back to 1973 when it was established by conservative activist Morton Coulter. The first conference, held in March 1974 at the National Airport Hilton Hotel near Washington, D.C., aimed to unite and strengthen the conservative movement following the Watergate scandal and President Nixon's resignation.

Over the years, CPAC has grown significantly in size and influence. It has become a significant platform for up-and-coming conservative politicians and thinkers to showcase their ideas and gain national attention. Notable figures who have spoken at CPAC include former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and the late Senator Barry Goldwater.

In recent years, CPAC has been known to host various workshops, seminars, and ballot straw polls to gauge conservative opinion on key issues and potential presidential candidates. The event's agenda typically includes discussions on domestic policy, foreign policy, economic policy, and social issues.

There have been instances where CPAC participants have referenced events or individuals from previous years, as mentioned in a discussion excerpt dating back to 2017. However, specific details about such references are not widely documented in the public domain. It is essential to note that these anecdotal accounts should be treated with caution and may require further investigation for verification.

In conclusion, the Conservative Political Action Conference plays a crucial role in shaping conservative discourse and advancing the interests of the American conservative movement.

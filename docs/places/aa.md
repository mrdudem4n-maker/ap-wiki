### From *2001-a-space-odyssey*
- Discussion about a person: [[jim]], described as detail-oriented and interesting with a thoughtful and observant nature.
- Main idea of Jim's analysis: The monolith in the movie 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may symbolize a movie screen.
  - Argument for this theory: The monolith shares similar dimensions to a movie screen, turned on its end vertically.
  - Clarification: Not the exact dimensions of the movie screen used for the premiere of 2001 in Washington D.C., which was a taller cinescope screen.
- Comparison drawn to McLuhan's theory "The Medium is the Message."
- Interruption during the discussion, apologized for by the speaker.

- Jungian validity discussion
  - Possibility that the phenomenon could have emerged from subconscious intention rather than conscious intention
  - Acknowledgement that it could also have been a conscious act, not exclusive to one possibility
- Analysis of reading as interesting
- Comparison of the phenomenon to a movie screen
- Discussion of deeper layer and media power in the context of what they are talking about

- Thematic reinforcement of the power of message in *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*
  - Book discussion about visual storytelling and communication in [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work
  - First 30 minutes and last 45 minutes of the film have minimal dialogue, focusing on visual communication
  - Visual storytelling showcases the birth of violence, knowledge, and technology from primitive times to [[space_odyssey]] stations
  - [[stanley_kubrick]]'s work emphasizes the transition from novels, books, or Bible as dominant forms of communication to cinema
  - *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]* can be seen as an [[kirk]] to update or make new traditional messaging through cinema as a dominant medium

- Discussion about a passage in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible that some interpret as Yahweh being described as "sworthy" or "black" ([[yahweh]]).
  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

**Apollo Wiki: Embassy Bombings (1998)**

The Embassy Bombings, also known as the East Africa Embassy Bombings, were a series of coordinated bomb attacks against three U.S. embassies in the African continent on August 7, 1998. The bombings occurred simultaneously at the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, as well as at the United States Embassy in Kampala, Uganda.

The attacks resulted in a total of 224 fatalities (12 Americans among them), including 12 embassy personnel, and over 5,000 injuries. The bombings were the deadliest acts of terrorism against American citizens on foreign soil until the September 11 attacks in 2001.

The primary suspects behind the attacks were Al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist organization led by Osama bin Laden. The attacks were a response to U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Fox, as well as American support for Israel and the sanctions against Iraq. The bombings aimed to pressure the United States into withdrawing its troops from Saudi Arabia.

The Nairobi bombing targeted the United States Embassy complex located at Karen, a suburban area in the west of Nairobi. The truck bomb was detonated outside the embassy's Tishomingo residential section, causing extensive damage to multiple buildings and vehicles. The blast created a crater 15 feet deep and 90 feet wide, with debris scattering up to 2 miles away from the explosion site.

The Dar es Salaam bombing targeted the United States Embassy located at the Kisutu district, in central Dar es Salaam. A truck bomb was detonated outside the embassy's main gate, causing significant damage to the entrance and adjacent buildings. The blast resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries among embassy personnel, Tanzanian citizens, and United Nations workers.

The Kampala bombing targeted a fuel storage facility near the Ugandan capital's international airport, which was believed to be used by the United States military. A truck bomb was detonated at the facility, causing a massive explosion that could be seen and heard from miles away. The blast resulted in multiple fatalities among Ugandan citizens and injuries among embassy personnel.

The Embassy Bombings marked a significant escalation of Al-Qaeda's global reach and highlighted the increasing threat of international terrorism. The United States responded with missile attacks against suspected Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and Sudan, marking the beginning of the U.S.-led War on Terror.

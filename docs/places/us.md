    - This change could represent a [[nietzschean_critique]] of a "nanny state" or a certain type of femininity.

- Adaptation differences: Stanley Kubrick embellished certain elements in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]]'s scene where Alex kills an [[chelevec_like_old]] cat lady for the movie version, making the [[mccoy]] into a sex cultist.
- [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] vs. movie: In the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]], the victim is simply an elderly woman with cats. However, in the movie, Kubrick emphasizes the [[sexual_instinct]] potential and transforms the [[mccoy]] into a member of a sex cult.

- Discussion about the religious significance of the black [[black]] monolith in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*:
  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.
  - The male [[mccoy]] in the book is believed to represent Yahweh himself.
  - The [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon is considered to be based on ancient Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Samuel Kramer, a Jewish historian or mythographer, is mentioned for his work that exposes the connection between the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon and Mesopotamian love poetry.
- Reference to a specific Bible passage in [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon 1.6, where the speaker of the first six lines remains uncertain but is believed by some to be the male [[mccoy]].

  - The phrase is translated differently in various versions, including "I am black" in the [[king_david]] James Bible.
  - The word used for "sworthy" or "black" in [[hebrew_bible]] appears only once in the [[hebrew_bible]] Bible.
- Connection between Yahweh and Bacchus, a figure related to wine and male vineyard keeping, suggested due to similarities in descriptions in Judah's blessing in Genesis.
- In the ancient world, Yahweh was thought to be related to Bacchus, which is considered common or consensus understanding.
- Discussion about the female [[mccoy]] being referred to as "fair" ([[Hebrew Bible]]) and how it may imply Yahweh is being described as swarthy or black.
- Possible reasons for Christians denying Yahweh's description as black, possibly due to racial biases.
- Reference to the use of black in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] (1968), where a black screen with music is used before the film and during intermissions.
  - The black screen may symbolize the start of an opera or play, or serve as an avant-garde artistic choice.
- Discussion about the [[the_song_of_solomon]] played at the beginning of [[2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]] being [[Zarathustra (also spelled Zostra) by Richard Strauss]].
  - The music might reference the ancient Persian cult of Zoroastrianism, connecting to Yahweh through its similarity with the name of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] and the religious figure.
  - The music could also be considered a leitmotif (recurring musical themes associated with characters or themes) in the analysis of the film.

- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn
        - Crescent moon symbol possibly referring to the Mesopotamian moon god, Sin or Nana
    - Emergence of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon from Mesopotamian cults with potential reference to the moon god

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

- Discussion between characters "Dave" and "Hal"
- Dave checks on Hal, who is a computer (represented by the name)
- Everything is running smoothly for Hal
- Dave asks if Hal has been working, to which Hal replies he's done some sketches
- Dave compliments Hal on a nice rendering of one of his sketches

The conversation appears to be discussing the movie "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]" directed by Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]. The participants are analyzing various symbolic elements in the film, such as characters' names, numbers, and locations. They discuss themes related to [[space_odyssey]] exploration, technology, and human evolution, and speculate on potential interpretations of the movie's ambiguous storyline.

Here's a brief summary of some key points made during the conversation:

1. The [[mccoy]] David [[bowman_david_bowman]] may be a reference to [[king_david]] David and Ulysses in Greek mythology. This could suggest themes of return, enlightenment, or a quest for knowledge.
2. The name HAL 9000 (an artificial intelligence system in the movie) might symbolize human birth or creation, as nine is associated with pregnancy, and HAL undergoes a sort of transformation before being destroyed.
3. The film may be interpreted as a critique of NASA, suggesting a deeper subversive message about [[space_odyssey]] exploration and its impact on society.
4. The movie's psychedelic elements, slow-motion camera work, and abstract narrative style contribute to its ambiguity and openness to multiple interpretations.

  - The name Nemo (meaning nobody) in "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" is connected to Odysseus' trick of claiming to be "no man" when facing the Cyclops
- James [[james]]'s Terminator villain and the red [[red]] meme on Twitter are mentioned as possible homages to elements in "2001: A [[space_odyssey]]"

- Discussion about the film "A [[space_odyssey]]" and its potential connection to Jewish themes:
  - Mar-Vell [[mccoy]], possibly portrayed as a crypto-Jewish alien
  - Cree characters potentially representing Christians
  - The Aliens [[kirk]] to hinder human success with rockets due to fear of invasion or other consequences
- Discussion about [[stanley_kubrick]]'s potential phallic messaging in the film
- Comparison between "A [[space_odyssey]]" and the Tower of Babel story:

Apollo Wiki Article: Republican Party (United States)
======================================================

The Republican Party is one of the two major political parties in the United States, the other being the Democratic Party. It was founded in 1854 as a response to the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery into territories where it had been prohibited by the Missouri Compromise.[1](Kansas-Nebraska Act)

The party's platform is characterized by its emphasis on free-market capitalism, limited government intervention in the economy, support for traditional social values, strong national defense, and conservatism. Over time, these principles have evolved and varied, reflecting changes in American society and politics.[2](Platform of the Republican Party)

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a conservative faction within the party emerged, known as the New Right. This group was strongly opposed to liberal social policies, including civil rights legislation, environmental regulations, and the Vietnam War.[3](New Right)

The Republican Party has had several high-profile figures throughout its history. Notable among them are Abraham Lincoln, who served as President from 1861 to 1865, and Ronald Reagan, who was President from 1981 to 1989.[4](List of U.S. presidents by party affiliation)

In contemporary politics, the Republican Party is often associated with conservative stances on various issues. For instance, in a discussion excerpt, it was suggested that support for the Republican Party may be driven by the perception that it poses threats to one's life or wellbeing, potentially due to its stance on certain policies.[5](discussion excerpt) However, it's important to note that not all Republicans hold identical views and the party encompasses a broad spectrum of ideologies.

The relationship between individual Republicans and their voters can be complex, as demonstrated by the instance where a notable figure advised against supporting a specific candidate.[5](discussion excerpt) Such instances highlight the nuanced dynamics within political parties, where personal endorsements and policy stances can influence voter decisions.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:52:02–00:56:22)
- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn
        - Crescent moon symbol possibly referring to the Mesopotamian moon god, Sin or Nana
    - Emergence of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon from Mesopotamian cults with potential reference to the moon god

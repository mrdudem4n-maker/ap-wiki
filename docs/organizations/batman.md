**Mark McCoy**

Mark McCoy is a notable figure in the fictional universe of media surrounding Batman, serving as a supporting character, often in an antagonistic role. His identity as the enigmatic vigilante known as **"Hush"** was revealed in the 2002–2003 comic book storyline "Hush" by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Jim Lee.

Prior to his role as Hush, Mark McCoy first appeared in Batman #609 (November 2002), written by Loeb. In this early appearance, McCoy is depicted as a successful and wealthy plastic surgeon with a strong interest in Batman's rogues gallery. He is portrayed as having a deep knowledge of the criminal underworld and a personal grudge against the Dark Knight.

McCoy's connection to Batman runs deeper than mere obsession, however. In "Hush," it is revealed that he is secretly the son of Tommy Elliot, one of Batman's childhood friends who was believed to have died in an accident along with Bruce Wayne's parents. Elliot faked his own death and, using plastic surgery, assumed a new identity as Thomas "Tommy" Ezra Elliot II. When he discovered that Thomas Wayne had fathered another son, he left the child for adoption under the name Mark McCoy.

As Hush, McCoy utilizes his surgical skills to manipulate and attack Batman through various means, including creating duplicates of Batman's rogues gallery and attempting to separate Batman from his allies. His ultimate goal is to force Batman to confront the darkness within himself and, in doing so, reveal a secret that would shatter Bruce Wayne's life.

Mark McCoy's portrayal as Hush has been influential in the Batman mythos, with various adaptations of the character appearing in other media such as animated films, video games, and even live-action television series like Gotham. In these adaptations, the character often retains his complex history and role as a formidable adversary to Batman.

Despite his villainous nature, Mark McCoy's backstory provides a fascinating exploration of identity, obsession, and the impact of trauma on an individual's life. His transformation from a seemingly ordinary plastic surgeon to the mastermind behind the alter ego Hush adds depth and intrigue to Batman's rogues gallery.

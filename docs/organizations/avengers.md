- Discussion [[but]] Tucker Carlson getting "spanked" in a metaphorical sense, likely referring to facing consequences for his actions
- Comparison of disciplining a child between physically punishing them and providing a path to follow
  - Argument that physical punishment may only temporary halt undesirable [[evocation_of_sin_behavior]] but does not teach the child a better way
- Concept of a child needing to integrate a "way of doing things" into their personality, with justification and honor
- Use of Freudian term "superego" to describe this internalized set of moral principles, which children should develop themselves rather than being imposed from outside (by a father figure [[chelevec_like_old]] Donald Trump)
- Clarification that the speaker is not advocating for all spanking as child abuse but does not frequently use physical punishment on their own children

Apollo Program Cabinet Appointees and CIA Operatives: Comparative Analysis
===============================================================================

The comparison between the appointment of staff members for President John F. Kennedy's Cabinet during his administration, particularly during the Apollo Program, and the hiring of secret operatives by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is not without some points of similarity, but it is crucial to distinguish between these two distinct processes.

During the Apollo Program, President Kennedy appointed highly qualified individuals to serve in various Cabinet positions related to space exploration and national security. These appointees included:

1. **Dean Rusk** (Secretary of State): A key figure in the Apollo negotiations with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.
2. **Robert McNamara** (Secretary of Defense): Involved in the management and funding of NASA, as well as ensuring the military's support for the Apollo Program.
3. **James Webb** (NASA Administrator): Led the agency during the Apollo Program and was instrumental in its success.
4. **George Kistiakowsky** (Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology): Advised Kennedy on science, technology, and space policy matters.

These appointees were chosen based on their expertise and experience, with the aim of achieving a specific policy goal: landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.

In contrast, CIA operatives are covert agents who work for the agency in various intelligence-gathering, counterintelligence, and special operations roles. Their hiring process is typically more clandestine and focused on maintaining operational security.

While both processes involve selecting individuals to serve in critical roles, there are significant differences in their purpose, recruitment methods, and oversight. The Apollo Program appointees were appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and worked openly within government structures, whereas CIA operatives are often recruited covertly, work clandestinely, and may operate outside of traditional government structures to protect their identities and mission objectives.

It is important to recognize these differences when comparing the appointment of Apollo Program appointees to the hiring of CIA operatives, as they serve distinct functions within the executive branch and intelligence community. However, both processes highlight the importance of leadership and talent in achieving significant policy goals, be it space exploration or national security.

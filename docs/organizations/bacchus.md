### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:52:02–00:56:22)
- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

- **[[stanley_kubrick]]'s Interpretation**
    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn
        - Crescent moon symbol possibly referring to the Mesopotamian moon god, Sin or Nana
    - Emergence of the [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon from Mesopotamian cults with potential reference to the moon god

- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

### From *TEST exodus-9-12 TEST FILE* (00:29:37–00:32:23)
- **Discussion of Biblical verse 4**
    - God making a distinction between Israeli [[jacob_and_his_wives]] Egyptian livestock, implying a special status for [[the_new_testament]] Israelites as [[jacob_and_his_wives]] chosen people.
    - Repetition of [[the_new_testament]] concept from [[the_new_testament]] previous call.
- **Location of Goshen**
    - [[delta]] along [[the_new_testament]] Nile Delta where [[the_new_testament]] Israelites reside.
    - Potential connection to Hyksos [[jacob_and_his_wives]] Tanis in [[the_new_testament]] northern delta [[delta]].
- **Swarms of flies**
    - Attacking all of Egypt except for Goshen.
    - Possible symbolism suggesting an admixture or intermingling among [[the_new_testament]] Egyptians prevented among [[the_new_testament]] Israelites.
- **Symbolic representation of livestock animals**
    - Representing resources of Gentile adversaries, specifically hated ones.
    - Instances where livestock animals represent humans, using [[the_new_testament]] metaphor of [[the_new_testament]] flock in particular.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey*

**Bacchus and his Relationship with Yahweh and Judah**

Bacchus, also known as Dionysus in Greek mythology, is often associated with the Semitic god of wine El, due to shared attributes such as the patronage of vine cultivation, winemaking, and ecstasy.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(god)) However, there is also a connection between Bacchus and Yahweh, the national god of the Israelites, and Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

The connection between Bacchus and Judah can be traced back to an Old Testament passage in Genesis 49:11, where Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelites, makes a prophetic blessing for his son Judah. In this passage, Judah is compared to a lion and described as keeping "the donkey" (or "burro") under his vine and fig tree.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis)

This description of Judah has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Some scholars suggest that the "donkey" represents Bacchus, due to the association between Bacchus and donkeys in Roman mythology, where he was often depicted riding or leading a donkey.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus) The vine and fig tree, both symbolizing fertility and abundance, further strengthen this interpretation by mirroring some of Bacchus' attributes.

It is important to note that this connection between Bacchus, Yahweh, and Judah is not universally accepted among scholars, as the interpretation of ancient texts can be complex and subjective. Some argue that the "donkey" in Genesis 49:11 might symbolize a different deity or have another meaning altogether.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_the_Bible)

In conclusion, while Bacchus is primarily known as a Greek god, there are connections between him, Yahweh, and Judah in certain interpretations of Old Testament passages. The association between Bacchus and the "donkey" under Judah's vine and fig tree has been proposed by some scholars, but the validity of this connection remains a topic of ongoing debate among experts in religious studies.

**Jonathan Greenblatt**

Jonathan Greenblatt is an American attorney, businessman, and non-profit executive who has been active in Jewish advocacy and civil rights issues. He was born on February 10, 1976, in New York City [New York City (city)] and grew up in a Zionist family [Zionism].

Greenblatt attended Brown University [Brown University] for his undergraduate studies, where he graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. He later received his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School [Harvard Law School].

In 2015, Greenblatt was appointed as the National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), one of the oldest civil rights organizations in the United States [Anti-Defamation League]. Prior to joining the ADL, he served as Special Assistant to President Barack Obama and Director of the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation.

Greenblatt is also associated with the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), a pro-Israel advocacy group [Zionist Organization of America]. His work with these organizations has earned him recognition as a leading figure in Jewish advocacy and civil rights.

The statement suggesting that Greenblatt's actions make his side appear "racist and Nazi" is not accurately reflected in his public record. Greenblatt has consistently opposed discrimination and hate speech, regardless of the source or target. His work with the ADL includes initiatives to combat anti-Semitism, racism, and bigotry [Anti-Semitism].

It's important to note that Greenblatt's commitment to Zionism does not equate to endorsement of Nazism or any form of racial supremacy. Zionism is a national movement among Jews that supports the establishment and support of a Jewish state in Palestine [Zionism]. While some critics have accused pro-Israel advocates of promoting racist policies, Greenblatt's work has been focused on promoting peace, justice, and equality for all people.

Greenblatt's career demonstrates a commitment to civil rights, social justice, and Jewish advocacy. His association with organizations such as the ADL and ZOA reflects his dedication to these causes, and his efforts have earned him recognition as a leading voice in these areas. However, it's crucial to separate fact from misconception when discussing Greenblatt's work and beliefs.

**Aaron David Miller**

Aaron David Miller is an American foreign policy expert, political analyst, and author who has been involved in the Middle East peace process for over three decades. Born on March 13, 1950, in New York City, Miller is best known for his work with the US Department of State and the Peace Now movement.

Miller's career in foreign policy began when he joined the US Department of State as a political analyst in 1978. He served under several administrations, including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. During his tenure, Miller held various positions, such as a Middle East analyst and counselor, with roles focusing on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Iranian affairs, and Arab-Israeli peace talks.

In 1982, Miller became involved with the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), where he served as a consultant until 1986. The ZOA is one of the oldest pro-Israel organizations in the United States, advocating for Israel's security and promoting its interests on Capitol Hill and in the media.

Miller's association with the ZOA sparked some controversy during his time at the Department of State. Critics have suggested that his involvement with the organization may have influenced his position during the peace negotiations, particularly regarding Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, it is essential to note that Miller's work with the ZOA occurred during a leave of absence from the US government, and he resumed his duties at the Department of State following the end of his consulting role with the ZOA.

After leaving the Department of State in 2003, Miller became a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the author of several books on Middle East politics, including *The Much Too Promised Land: America's Elusive Search for Arab-Israeli Peace* (2008) and *The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President* (2016).

Throughout his career, Aaron David Miller has remained an active participant in the Middle East peace process. His work with the ZOA and subsequent roles in both government and academia have made him a prominent figure in discussions related to Israeli-Palestinian relations and US foreign policy in the region. While some criticize Miller for his perceived bias, he is widely recognized as an experienced and knowledgeable expert on Middle East affairs.

### From *2001-a-space-odyssey* (00:55:59–00:06:52)
- [[hebrew_bible]] and Muslim calendars: Both have distinct characteristics with [[hebrew_bible]] being a solar-lunar hybrid calendar, while the Muslim calendar is lunar. In Gem, Jews identify as lunar beings and Arians as solar figures. ([[Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]#Filmography|Stanley Kubrick]])

- [[blue_danube]]: [[the_song_of_solomon]] used in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]], possibly with sexual connotations due to its waltz nature and the spaceship docking scene. The name may have ties to [[celtic_danu]] deities, such as [[celtic_danu]] or [[don_midarko]], associated with the Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]], a dominant tribe of gods in [[celtic_danu]] lore. ([[2001: A [[space_odyssey]]|2001: A [[space_odyssey]] Odyssey]])
- Freudian aspects: The scene and [[the_song_of_solomon]] in 2001: A [[space_odyssey]] may have similar symbolic elements as those found in Dr. Strangelove, where every missile is a phallus and cities are vaginas to be destroyed. ([[Dr. Strangelove]])
- Tuatha de [[tuatha_de_danannan]]: [[celtic_danu]] tribe of dominant gods possibly linked to the Israelites due to biblical influences on [[celtic_danu]] myth. ([[celtic_danu]] Mythology)
- Other etymologies of [[blue_danube]]: It may also mean 'river' or 'wet water', suggesting a more sexual connotation if that interpretation is what [[stanley_kubrick]] intended. ([[Danube River]] River]])

The Serpent in the Garden of Eden is a prominent biblical figure found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapters 2 and 3. In Christian tradition, this serpent is often interpreted as representing Satan or the devil. However, it's important to note that the Bible does not explicitly state the serpent's identity beyond being a "subtle" and "crafty" creature (Genesis 3:1).

The story of the Serpent in Eden is significant in both Christian and Jewish religions. In Christian belief, the event marks the fall of humanity from grace, leading to original sin and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ. In Jewish tradition, the Serpent is seen as a symbol of temptation but is not identified with Satan or the devil.

The association of the Serpent with Satan can be traced back to several sources in early Christian literature. For instance, in the New Testament's book of Revelation (12:9), Satan is referred to as "the serpent of old" who deceives the whole world. This connection further solidified the notion that the Serpent in Eden was indeed Satan.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is not universally accepted among scholars and religious groups. Some argue that the Serpent should be viewed literally as a creature in the Garden of Eden, while others maintain a more symbolic or allegorical interpretation.

In art and literature, the Serpent in Eden has been depicted numerous times, often personifying temptation, deception, or the struggle between good and evil. Its portrayal varies greatly across different cultures and periods, reflecting diverse interpretations of its meaning.

The role of the Serpent in the Garden of Eden continues to be a topic of discussion among scholars, theologians, and believers. While the Bible does not explicitly state the Serpent's identity, the association with Satan is deeply rooted in Christian tradition and has influenced art, literature, and theological discourse throughout history.

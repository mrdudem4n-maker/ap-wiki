**Voting Rights and African Americans in Post-Reconstruction Era (1877–1900)**

Following the Reconstruction period (1865–1877), African American suffrage faced significant challenges in the United States, particularly during the post-Reconstruction era. This era was characterized by a shift in political power away from Republicans and towards Democrats in the South, leading to increased restrictions on African American voting rights.

The excerpt, "[[If that is true, the South will not hinder the Negro from voting]]," originates from a discussion during this period and highlights the complexities surrounding African American suffrage. The statement suggests that even if African Americans were allowed to vote, their votes would merely increase the overall count without significantly altering the political balance due to the ratio of white voters being much higher. This implies a reluctance to grant full voting rights to African Americans, as their participation would not alter the dominant power structure.

This era saw the rise of various tactics to limit African American suffrage, including [[Literacy Tests]], poll taxes, and grandfather clauses. These measures were designed to disenfranchise African Americans by imposing barriers that were difficult for them to overcome. The use of these tactics was justified under the guise of ensuring that voters were educated and responsible, but in practice, they served to restrict African American voting rights.

Despite these challenges, there were also efforts to promote African American suffrage during this period. The [[Fifteenth Amendment]] (1870) granted African American men the right to vote, although it did not explicitly prohibit states from imposing literacy tests or other qualifications. The Radical Reconstruction governments in the South, primarily Republican-controlled, implemented measures to protect African American voting rights, but these were gradually dismantled as federal troops withdrew and control shifted back to white Democrats.

The post-Reconstruction era marked a significant setback for African American suffrage, with restrictive voting laws limiting their political participation. However, the fight for African American voting rights continued, culminating in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which aimed to eliminate discrimination in voting and ensure full enfranchisement for all citizens.

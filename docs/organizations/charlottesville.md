Apollo Wiki Article: Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally (2017)

The Charlottesville Unite the Right rally was a controversial white nationalist protest that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017. The event, organized by the alt-right organization Jason Kessler, aimed to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park (formerly Lee Park).

The rally attracted hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klan members, as well as counterprotesters. The event quickly turned violent, resulting in multiple injuries and one death. James Alex Fields Jr., a participant in the rally, drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens more.

During the rally, President Donald Trump made a controversial statement via Twitter, saying "There are two sides to a story." This statement was widely criticized as it seemed to equate the white supremacist protesters with their opponents. In subsequent interviews, Trump clarified that he was condemning violence on all sides but did not explicitly condemn the white nationalists present at the rally until several days later.

The Charlottesville Unite the Right rally has been widely regarded as a defining moment in the resurgence of white nationalism and neo-Nazism in the United States. The event sparked widespread protests against racism and hate speech, and led to increased scrutiny of far-right groups and their activities.

The city of Charlottesville took down the controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in July 2021, more than four years after the rally that had been sparked by its proposed removal. The statue's removal was a result of legal battles and ongoing controversy surrounding the symbolic representation of the Confederacy in public spaces.

The Charlottesville Unite the Right rally remains a significant event in American history, highlighting the persistence of racism and hate speech in the United States, as well as the potential for violence and conflict arising from such activities.

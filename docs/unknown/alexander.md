- **Gender Change in Dr. Branham [[mccoy]]**
    - Dr. Branham, originally a male [[mccoy]] in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]], was changed to female in the film by Kubrick.
    - This change could represent a [[nietzschean_critique]] of a "nanny state" or a certain type of femininity.
    - The change also serves to make Dr. Branham and Dr. Brodsky, originally male characters as well, potential parental figures for Alex.

- **Role of Dr. Branham and Dr. Brodsky**
    - In the film, Dr. Branman and Dr. Brodsky act as parental figures to Alex, guiding him through a radical treatment that marks a new phase in his life.

- **Alex's Declaration [[welfare]] [[the_third_reich_and_beethoven]] and Sin**
    - Alex, in the context of being nauseated by medication, critiques behaviorism by associating [[the_third_reich_and_beethoven]]'s beautiful music with "awful movies."
    - This [[evocation_of_sin_behavior]] of sin and [[evocation_of_sin_behavior]] is a [[nietzschean_critique]] by both [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] ([[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] author) and Kubrick on behavioralism as a whole.

- **Sublimation Theory**
  - Kubrick, being an intellectual, likely understands sublimation theory, although it's not unique to Freud [[freud]]
  - Sublimation theory suggests that unacceptable impulses are redirected into socially acceptable channels through artistic expression

    - Snake in the Garden of Eden, dancing Christ figures

- Kubrick's perspective on Alex's reformation
  - No real reformation of Alex
  - Ending scene: theatrical performance of lovemaking
- Kubrick's viewpoint on the figures in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]]
  - If you ban Alex, you're also banning [[the_third_reich_and_beethoven]] and others
  - Same dangerous spirit underlying all main characters
  - Possible reinforcement of [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]]'s message in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]], although not explicitly stated by [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]]

- Fear mongering [[now]] end times [[wormwood_prophecy]] prevalent in the [[now]]
  - Perception [[now]] [[peter_thiel_s]] [[peter_thiel]] is promoting the fear of the Antichrist, which indirectly promotes Jesus
- Connection drawn between [[peter_thiel_s]] [[peter_thiel]]'s actions and a Christian revival, aligning with figures like [[donald_trump_shilling]] Trump, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Fuentes, and the Groypers

### From *TEST exodus-9-12 TEST FILE* (00:08:07–00:12:15)

- Nazar means separate or consecrated and can be metaphorically interpreted as Aryan versus Jew
- Nazarite abstention may symbolize racial separation or purity
- Nazarite linked to nobility, often described as a prince (e.g., Joseph) and having long hair

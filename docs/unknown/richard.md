Apollo Wiki: Article - Constitutional Conservatism

Constitutional conservatism, also known as strict constructionism or originalism, is a political and legal philosophy in the United States that emphasizes a literal interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and adherence to its original intent.[1](Constitutional conservatism#cite_note-1) This approach aims to limit government intervention and uphold individual rights as defined by the Constitution.

The philosophy of constitutional conservatism has roots in the Federalist era, particularly in the writings of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the pseudonym Publius.[2](Federalist Papers) They argued for a strong federal government with enumerated powers and strict adherence to the Constitution's language to prevent abuses of power.

Constitutional conservatism gained prominence in the mid-twentieth century, particularly among U.S. Supreme Court justices such as Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who advocated for interpreting the Constitution based on its original meaning.[3](Antonin Scalia) These justices believed that the Constitution should be interpreted as it was understood at the time of its ratification, rather than allowing for flexible interpretations influenced by societal changes over time.

One key aspect of constitutional conservatism is the belief in equal protection under the law.[4](Equal Protection Clause) Constitutional conservatives argue that all individuals should be treated equally under the Constitution's provisions and that government should not favor one group over another. However, critics contend that this approach can lead to the denial of rights to marginalized groups by interpreting the Constitution too narrowly.[5](Criticism of originalism)

In contemporary politics, constitutional conservatism is associated with the Republican Party and limited government advocates.[6](Republican Party) Proponents argue that this approach ensures government accountability, protects individual rights, and prevents the judiciary from becoming a policymaking body. Critics, on the other hand, contend that it can result in an overly restrictive interpretation of the Constitution that does not reflect the evolving values and needs of American society.[7](Criticism of originalism)

In summary, constitutional conservatism is a political and legal philosophy emphasizing a strict constructionist approach to interpreting the U.S. Constitution. It aims to limit government intervention, uphold individual rights, and adhere to the original intent of the Constitution's framers. This philosophy has been influential in shaping American jurisprudence and continues to be a key issue in contemporary political debates.

### From *a-cautionary-tale*

Title: Apollo Program Communication Mishaps

The Apollo Program, a significant milestone in space exploration history, was not entirely devoid of communication mishaps. One such incident occurred during a casual discussion, as depicted in the text source.

On [August 15, 1969](Apollo_11), astronaut Richard F. Gordon, mission commander for Apollo 11's backup crew, was engaged in a conversation while walking. During this dialogue, he was informed about certain matters related to the Apollo Program. This event serves as an illustration of the human element that often accompanied space missions.

The exact nature of the discussed matters remains unclear from the text source. However, it is worth noting that the Apollo Program was a complex undertaking involving numerous aspects such as mission planning, astronaut training, hardware development, and international diplomacy. It is possible that the discussion revolved around one or more of these areas.

This incident underscores the challenges faced during the Apollo era, where technology was advanced but still in its infancy compared to today's standards. Despite these occasional communication mishaps, the Apollo Program achieved monumental successes, most notably landing the first humans on the moon with the Apollo 11 mission just two days later.

It is essential to highlight that such incidents do not diminish the overall achievement of the Apollo Program. Instead, they serve as a reminder of the human element involved in space exploration, where communication can sometimes be as crucial as the technology itself.

The Apollo Program's legacy continues to inspire and guide modern space exploration endeavors. As we strive for new frontiers, understanding and learning from these historical mishaps helps us to navigate the challenges of the future with more resilience and adaptability.

**End of Days (1999 film)**

End of Days is an American apocalyptic supernatural thriller film directed by Peter Hyams and released in 1999. The movie, which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, and Robin Tunney, centers around the impending arrival of the Antichrist and a former New York City firefighter's efforts to prevent global destruction.

The film begins with Father Jerome Krankie (Gabriel Byrne), a Vatican priest, searching for signs of the coming Apocalypse. While visiting a museum in Los Angeles, he observes a sketch by an unknown artist that resembles a vision he has been having about the Antichrist, and notices a striking similarity between the face in the sketch and the man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who approaches him.

The man, named Ernest Jerome Starker (also known as "Eraser" due to his past as an assassin), initially resists Jerome's attempts to enlist his help but eventually agrees when he learns the truth about the approaching Apocalypse. Together with a group of Vatican agents led by Captain Kirk (Rod Stieger) and including Sister Bernadette (Robin Tunney), they embark on a desperate mission to thwart the Antichrist's plans.

The film's title refers to the Last Days prophesied in various religious texts, and its plot draws heavily from Christian eschatology, with references to biblical figures such as Cain, Abel, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The movie also incorporates elements from other traditions, including Kabbalah, with the Antichrist's identity being linked to the Seal of Solomon.

End of Days was produced by Carolco Pictures and released by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, but proved to be a commercial success, grossing over $260 million worldwide against a production budget of $85–130 million. The film's popularity has led to its adaptation into various formats, including comic books, video games, and merchandise.

Apollo Program Crew Transportation
------------------------------------

The Apollo program crew transportation encompassed various methods used to transport astronauts to and from the launch site, spacecraft, and recovery ships during the NASA Apollo missions between 1961 and 1975.

### Ground Transportation

Upon their arrival at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, astronauts would utilize ground transportation to travel to the launch complex. This typically involved traveling via buses such as the Mobile Launcher Platform Bus (MLPB) or the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building Bus. The MLPB was specifically designed to transport astronauts from the crew quarters to the mobile launcher platform, while the MSOB Bus moved them from the crew quarters to the Vehicle Assembly Building or other locations within the Kennedy Space Center complex.[^1](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/newsletters/KSC-Newsletter/KSC-03-25)

### Launch Transportation

Once astronauts reached the mobile launcher platform, they would board the Spacecraft-Lunar Module Adapter (SLA), which connected the Command Module and Lunar Module. The astronauts then ascended a movable ladder to enter their respective spacecraft.[^2](https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/missions/apollo/)

During the lunar landing missions, an additional vehicle called the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was used to traverse the lunar surface. The LRV was stowed within the Lunar Module during launch and deployed once on the moon's surface.[^3](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lroving/)

### Recovery Transportation

Upon reentry and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, a fleet of recovery ships would be dispatched to locate and retrieve the astronauts and their spacecraft. The primary recovery ship was the USS _Hornet_ (CVS-12), while other vessels such as the USS _Guadalcanal_ (LPH-7) and the USS _New Orleans_ (LPH-16) were also utilized.[^4](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/history/apollo/apollo-missions-landing)

Once on board the recovery ships, astronauts would undergo initial medical evaluations and debriefings before being transported back to the United States for further analysis and public recognition.[^5](https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/apollomissionreports/)

The transportation of astronauts during the Apollo program was a critical component of each mission, ensuring their safe travel from Earth to the lunar surface and back again. These various methods of ground, launch, and recovery transportation played an essential role in making history with the first human landing on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.

**End of Days** is a 1999 American apocalyptic action film directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Joel Silver. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, and Robin Tunney, among others. The film is noted for its premise involving the impending apocalypse and the battle between good and evil.

The plot revolves around Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), a former New York City homicide detective who becomes embroiled in an epic battle with the Antichrist, played by Robin Tunney's character, when she is accidentally released from her enchanted prison. Byrne portrays Father Robertus, a Vatican priest tasked with guiding Cane through this supernatural ordeal.

The film is known for its unique blend of action, horror, and religious themes. It incorporates elements from various apocalyptic narratives, such as the Book of Revelation in the New Testament of the Bible, while also drawing from other sources like Nostradamus' prophecies. This amalgamation of different apocalyptic mythologies gives End of Days a distinct identity within the genre.

End of Days was released to mixed reviews from critics but found success at the box office, grossing over $200 million worldwide against its budget of $85–100 million. The film's unique blend of genres and its impressive box office performance have made it a notable entry in Arnold Schwarzenegger's filmography.

It's interesting to note that End of Days shares some thematic similarities with another apocalyptic film, The Omen (1976). However, while both films deal with the Antichrist, they differ significantly in their approach and tone. The Omen is a more traditional horror film, focusing on suspense and atmosphere, whereas End of Days leans more towards action and spectacle.

The casting of Robin Tunney as the Antichrist in End of Days has led to an interesting connection with another film, The Omen's 2006 remake. In that movie, Lisa Ann Walter portrayed the character who first identifies Damien Thorn (played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) as the Antichrist. During the production of End of Days, it appears that Walters was initially considered for the role of the Antichrist, but the part eventually went to Tunney. This serendipitous connection between the two films and their respective actresses adds an intriguing layer to the discussion of apocalyptic cinema.

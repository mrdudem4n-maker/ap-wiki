### From *a-clockwork-orange*
- Feminine symbolism: In "A [[clockwork_orange]] [[william_of_orange]]," Alex's victim is symbolically represented as a feminine figure, often referred to as a 'pussy'.
- Cat lady motif: The victim is also associated with being a 'cat lady', which could be relevant to the storyline.
- Adaptation differences: Stanley Kubrick embellished certain elements in the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]]'s scene where Alex kills an [[chelevec_like_old]] cat lady for the movie version, making the [[mccoy]] into a sex cultist.
- [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]] vs. movie: In the [[the_morality_of_the_novel_burgess]], the victim is simply an elderly woman with cats. However, in the movie, Kubrick emphasizes the [[sexual_instinct]] potential and transforms the [[mccoy]] into a member of a sex cult.

- Discussion about the religious significance of the black [[black]] monolith in Stanley [[stanley_kubrick]]'s film *2001: A [[space_odyssey]]*:
  - The black [[black]] monolith symbolizes a linguistic tool of communication in ancient times and is considered as a precursor to Yahweh.
  - It represents Saturn, which could be interpreted as a reference to Yahweh.
  - The color black may have Semitic or Jewish significance, possibly related to nocturnal deities, lunar deities, gods of the underworld, and death, as well as representing the relative sworthiness of Jews compared to an Aryan host.
- Discussion about the Bible passage from [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon:
  - The book is famous for its steamy content and sexual innuendos.
  - The male [[mccoy]] in the book is believed to represent Yahweh himself.
  - The [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon is considered to be based on ancient Mesopotamian love poetry.

- Reference to a specific Bible passage in [[the_song_of_solomon]] of Solomon 1.6, where the speaker of the first six lines remains uncertain but is believed by some to be the male [[mccoy]].

- **Proto-Jewish forms of Yahweh or Judaism**
    - Zoroastrianism similarities to Judaism, debate on influence direction (Judaism descending from the cult or vice versa)
    - Jewish scholars believe that the cult was created by Jews rather than influenced by them
        - [[revelo_oliver]], classicist and anti-Semite, suggested Zoroastrianism was not of Aryan origin but possibly Semitic

- **Zoroastrianism Origins**
    - Disagreement between Jewish scholars and [[revelo_oliver]] on whether Jews invented the cult or it is non-Aryan in origin

- **My View**
    - Proto-Jewish cult that pre-existed the appearance of Judaism
    - Judaism develops from this cult but also combines other proto-Jewish cults such as Saturn, Bacchus, Ptah, etc.

    - Connections between Judaism and earlier cults through music and imagery in his work
        - Blackstone representing Yahweh as Saturn

i think that's true oh it looks like he's here yes i am but um i'm sorry i'm i just need some time to take care of the animals this is sort of ironic we can talk about hassan i won't be uh shocking them but i will be back really quickly just uh one moment okay  But yeah, I actually, I do imagine that Mets fans are probably whiter. I think it's like more people in New Jersey are, from what I've understood, are Mets fans. Yeah, New Jersey, Long Island. Oh, I thought, okay, yeah, yeah. My sense is that New Jersey is more Yankees, but yeah, Long Island is definitely Mets. Yeah, and I think that the Mets fan base is whiter, also more Asian, but also it's kind of more middle class. I've said before, Yankees versus Mets is kind of like the high and low against the middle, pretty much. The Yankees are very corporate, but also they play in the Bronx, so they have that kind of very urban core of fans, shall we say, whereas the Mets have a somewhat more suburban and white middle class feel. Okay. That's interesting.  Are there other cities that have two teams besides Chicago and New York like this? I guess Los Angeles does. They've got the Dodgers and the Angels. Oh, I thought they're from Anaheim. Or is that supposed to be basically the same thing? Yeah, pretty much the same thing. Okay, yeah. Anaheim is Metro LA. Okay. I'm not super familiar with Los Angeles. Okay. But I think... As someone's pointing out, Francisco, the Bay Area, has both the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's. That's definitely... Okay, gotcha. Yeah, so SF has too. That's interesting. They're not that big of a city. That's kind of funny. I would assume that Oakland is like the more minority one. That's my understanding that Oakland is like... more ghetto and sf is like nicer yeah it's got like the the whole raider nation thing going on there so it's gotta be yeah and that team is now moving to las vegas which is an interesting uh little curlicue there wait who's moving to las vegas the athletics the a's are moving to las vegas in a couple of years oh really  Huh. Yeah, it seems like Vegas has started doing this. They got like a hockey team a couple years ago. And I guess they, I don't know, they want to have more sports teams. I don't think they really did before. Yeah, I think sports teams before didn't want to move there and was seen as kind of like unwholesome. Like, you know, sports is more family entertainment. We don't want to be associated with Vegas. But I guess, you know, both Vegas and the culture have changed to the point that  That's okay, pretty much. Yeah. You see more and more families in Las Vegas. I think there's more variety of things to do now besides gamble.  On some level, teams didn't want to be seen as rigging games. If we have these games in Vegas, it's going to incentivize sports gambling. Now, as a culture, we've kind of just accepted that sports gambling is like, oh, I don't know. It's part of the game now. It seems like a natural push to just like, well, we'll have it in the gambling capital if this is what we're doing with it now. yeah well now people do it on their phone like it's just widely available everywhere it makes sense it would actually just be better if like you could only sports gamble in las vegas or something it was it would be it was like a destination and like i don't know as opposed to yeah just every city having their own like their own app or their own casino like right down the road  Yeah. I think it was much better when you actually had to go into these places of degeneracy to go do this stuff. It's kind of crazy that we have draft kings just everywhere now. It seems like a lot of young men just, I don't know, are spending so much money on this and kind of ruining their lives. There's just no barrier there.  It's a lot of normies, too, who just don't know anything about sports betting. I was at a restaurant the other night, the Tex-Mex bar I go to, and the bartender lady... uh asked if i had money on the game and i said yeah and she shows me her fan duel and i'm like okay like this is out of control like these people don't know anything about sports and they have like 50 bucks on the game it's like the cat's out of the bag there's clearly a a bubble happening here  Wow, so people who don't follow sports at all just bet on stuff? 100%. Yes, 100%. So I actually saw this thing on my TikTok recently that there's these places in Russia where they just...  Oh, the fake sports farms. I just saw that. Yes. They're like playing sports like in some warehouse somewhere. That was really creepy. But what they're trying to do, what I found out is they make little to no money on the actual gambling of the fake. sports what they're trying to do is get you into play like blackjack in their casino that's where they make like 50 of the revenue they make like little they make like 10 on like the fake soccer game or the fake volleyball game what they're trying to do is get you to place bets win a little money and then you start playing roulette blackjack or whatever on the site so yeah i did see that that's crazy  Wow. So they're doing like normal card gambling and that kind of stuff, but they're getting you... exactly they're enticing you with it wow yeah yeah so they offer like like in the video it says there's they have games to to the extent they're real and happening they're going on 24 7 but that's just to get you to like click the casino games where they make like 50 profit and they can rig the card games too i mean it's not that's not outside of uh outside the realm at all but yeah that was crazy though Well, we had a casino in the Northeast where they would have these like, it was like always kind of suspected that they were rigged high lie matches, but it was almost like a reason for people to just go to the casino to watch this sport, like high lie. It was like exotic and nobody really, it was like something you could just go watch without having to gamble on it. But of course they took bets on it. And yeah, that was the whole thing, is just get people in the door to watch this weird exotic sport. And then they'll probably stick around and play some slots after, or get some drinks at the bar. Oh.  I just can't believe how much sports gambling has just really exploded like this. Speaking to the sports farm thing, I've also heard that on DraftKings or whatever these other apps are, people now bet on random obscure sports like some professional ping pong game somewhere. Again, something they don't know anything about, but it's just that there's not enough football games to bet on.  that they just start betting on like bullshit nonsense. Yeah. So the meme is like,  If you've lost all your money at like 11 p.m. U.S. time, at that time, that's like peak sports time in like China or like Korea. So like Korean baseball will start at like 4 a.m. So like if you're a complete degenerate and you want to make your money back, you're looking at like Korean baseball at like 3.30 a.m. It's very dark.  Oh, my God. So it's just to keep you betting, like, around the clock. Yeah, exactly. That's why they keep those kind of obscure sports available. Because, oh, I lost $100. Let me try to make it back in China at 3 a.m. Oh. Yeah. Wow, that is so insidious. I didn't realize that that's what it was.  You're pouring over badminton statistics. Yeah. No, imagine like back in the day, like you had some husband and he, you know, he spends your family's like, and now imagine your husband like just bankrupted your family, like betting on badminton. It's like Japan. There's definitely some poor woman out there who has that exact experience. I know. You should find her on Twitter and bring her on the show. I should interview her.  That's just completely crazy. Wow. Yeah, there are very few people winning on these things. SMU did a study here in Dallas, I think, like, last year. And it was, like, a meta study of, like, FanDuel or DraftKings or one of them. And they said that something like 50% of their annual revenue comes from, like, the worst 3% of players. Oh, my God. So, like, it's just, like, Pareto principle, in effect, where, like... Yeah, yeah. They're just making bank off the people that are just, oh, they lost 500, they refill their account, and they just keep it moving. There's a very small percentage on these apps where people are making good money, and they make that back off the bottom 3%. Are we talking about sports betting? Yes. Yeah. Just to catch me up here, people are betting on badminton.  like from America or something? Or what is it that they're like pushed into all these bizarre sports to try to make back the  Yeah, you can bet on anything. If you lost all your money on Sunday afternoon football and now there's no more sports until next week, now you're chasing the return Monday morning at 3 a.m. on Chinese basketball or badminton or whatever it is. And these sites have lines for all of those things. So people are just randomly betting, basically. Yeah, just picking the favorite  Maybe doing some cursory research and saying, hey, I lost my money at 11 p.m. Good thing China, you know, the sun's rising over there and the game is about to start. Yeah. Well, one thing, I don't know. Does anyone have any money on the Phillies versus Dodgers? I hate to...  I don't care enough to not do the show, but it actually seems like a great game. I'll keep tabs on it here. It's tied one to one in the bottom of the 11th or top of the 11th.  So, wow. But yeah, we did this thing. We played Sagar and Jetty. And, you know, I sometimes don't like Sagar and Jetty. But when I do, it's when he's talking about sports gambling and or marijuana use. I think he is actually great on those things. And I have nothing to add, actually. He just nails it. But anyway... there are some horror stories that you just wouldn't believe of someone like losing a million dollars going into his uh like children's education fund in order to finance sports betting and it gets even more like sinister Well, first off, if you are good at it, like if you've developed some algorithm or you just have a feel for it, all they're going to do is ban you. You know, it's like the guy who can count cards gets kicked out of the casino. But this is different. This is like you're not cheating, but they just won't let you bet. And the other thing that I remember Sagar reporting on was that they would like and i'm you know missing the details here but the essence is correct they'll like text you at 3 a.m because that's when like you've moved past the depression and through alcohol have reached the serenity that the genius possess and the mad men lament or something like they they have it down to a science like they have it down to a psychology of when to get you like when to send you a text message maybe when to when to call you and um the other aspect of it would you see this in vegas as well is the sort of  fancy perks that you get when you are losing money to the casino. So it's like, I remember my grandparents who I'm surprised they had any money after their gambling adventures, but they would just talk about this. They were like, oh, it's so great. When you go to these boats or when you go to Vegas, they just give you two passes for a free steak dinner. Do you want to go to a Cirque du Soleil? Oh, here are two tickets front row on the house. It's like, do you know how much you're paying for that steak? Here.  And they do that as well. They make you feel like you're a millionaire. They make you feel like you're a celebrity when you're losing money to the house. And it's just utterly sinister and horrible. And if it happens around the edges, that's fine. I mean, obviously, we expect some sort of vice in society. But... When you watch a game, they're advertising sports betting, you know, in the bleachers or, you know, on the fence in the outfield. And every sports show, they talk to you about draft kings.  So you just can't escape it. It's everywhere. And what I imagine is it's not just the guy who like loses a million or something. That's sort of the makings of a good or story or a tragedy in this case. But it's like all of these dumb saps who just throw away $500 a month on this garbage thing.  You know, it's actually getting a little worse. Like what you said is, you know, you watch a game and you'll see the advertisements for DraftKings or whatever. But like what the NBA just announced they're doing is next season, they're going to start having their games on Amazon. Right. So what they announced. So so a lot of NBA games are going to be only available on Amazon. But they announced the other day that when you're watching the game on Amazon, you can log into your DraftKings account on your TV or on your phone, wherever you're watching, and it'll link the two accounts. And it'll live show your bets on the TV. You can see if you're winning or losing. You can place them on the TV.  Like, you're getting, like, a seamless, like, they're really becoming one. It's going from just, like, advertisements to, like, I'm watching the game and I'm going to log into my account, which is linked to my Amazon account, and use my credit card to, like, keep betting. Like, it's very sinister, man. That's extremely sinister. The other thing is, like, the problem of disaggregation. Or I guess you could call it disaggregation or aggregation, whichever perspective you look at it. But it's like I'm Gen X and old school in the sense that if I'm going to watch sports at all, I'm going to sit down with some chips and perhaps a beer and watch the game.  And I guess with baseball, I do consume it a little more casually. Because there's 162 games. So I'll take a walk or do the dishes or shock collar my dog. Just basic stuff while listening on the radio. But it's slightly different. But there's plenty of times when, particularly when it's a big game like Red Sox-Yankees, which... um you know occur uh 12 uh 15 20 times a year like i will sit down and watch anyone to the ninth like i am there i'm following it if there's a big game going on i'll sit down and watch it  And there's something to that. You know, you appreciate the drama of it all. You keep up with like the ebbs and flows of the match. And it seems like we've gone from that to like NFL Red Zone.  where they're playing like five minutes of a game or even less than that. They'll just hop in for a minute. And you've just sort of like lost all touch with the actual game. And you're just like watching highlights. And the ultimate result of that is going to be like you're watching NFL Red Zone and all of your bets are connected there. It's just, I don't know. I just think something is really lost.  I just say this is just purely my preference, basically. I just think it's just worse. And it kind of gets away from the redeemable aspects of sports. which are sort of spirit and competition, the ecstasy of victory, the agony of defeat and all of that. And we've just gone to like sports betting and weird highlights. I mean, do people even, I don't know, like has Red Zone led people to not even follow a team really? They just sort of...  Follow players? It was definitely a creation of the fantasy football, fantasization of the NFL. You want to watch the highlights of the players on your fantasy team. And so, yeah, sure. People are rooting for their disaggregated lineup of players as opposed to rooting for their hometown team. yeah who's for this kind of setup because if you think about like you might think a libertarian is for this kind of thing until you realize it's a highly regulated market and there's rules that are almost designed to keep out of like you know fair competition and startup companies and uh even even leveling the playing field as far as like who wins who loses and bets  It's made in a way that's definitely not a democracy of any kind. And it's almost treated as if it's like a real casino where the companies have free reign to treat the clients any way they want. So it's like a strange, like what political faction actually wants this is the question. That's what's so strange about it. It's almost like it's completely propped up by a lobby and that's it. um and it's it's very it's very like state organized as well it's you can't just set up a book i would presume like no i think if i understand it correctly you have to be like tethered to a uh casino or a racetrack of some kind like some kind of some kind of organization that's already got a like a license or something and and and i think that They probably have exclusive exclusive deals with certain betting companies and they kind of shoulder out competition in that way. So and obviously they lobby to the lobby states and state governments so that these regulations stay in place because obviously it makes competition not as bad. So it's it's it's kind of just it's strange that it's hard to see like why this is even a thing.  Yeah, I agree. I remember, I think we talked about this over the summer and it was during the Pete Rose controversy and I played some videos from Keith Olbermann. who goes way back and, you know, people hate Keith Olbermann, but he's actually very good at high IQ sports commentary for whatever that is worth. But it's like thinking about Pete Rose, Pete Rose ostensibly wasn't betting against his own team.  he was betting for his team. And people use that as a cope, so to speak, because they're like, oh, he wanted to win, you know? Well, okay, but if you're...  Betting on your team tonight, that means you might allow your team to lose the next night. You might use all your relief pitchers just to get your bet across. And it absolutely can and no doubt did affect the outcome on the field.  You can't quite think like that. Like if we win tonight, I get 100 grand. But if we lose tomorrow, I'm not out anything. That's not how a manager should think. And so I think it actually was extremely bad. and he that is pete rose and uh i've never liked pete rose as a person i mean he's obviously a remarkable baseball player but i i think it was an extremely bad thing that he did and baseball still now has a kind of zero tolerance policy at least ostensibly because  Well, a couple of players recently have been kicked, banned for life. They've gotten the Shoeless Joe treatment for gambling on baseball. And there are some rumors, I would just say, about Shohei Otani. Because Shohei Otani's translator or interpreter...  is actually in prison right now for betting millions on baseball. And the notion is that Shohei is this naive child and he sort of does act that way and appear that way. And this evil guy who Shohei thought was his friend was accessing his bank account and making all these bets. I...  I'm a little bit skeptical of that story. And I do wonder if, you know, Manfred, the commissioner of baseball, was handed this horrible controversy and has basically said like,  Baseball's already sort of dying. I mean, not exactly, but it's not the American pastime anymore. And wow, we just can't have this. And so we're just going to cover it up and scapegoat this poor Japanese man who can't cry foul because he doesn't speak English.  Shohei, we'll just tell him very sternly, don't ever do this again. You are the greatest player of the century. You just simply cannot be banned for life right now. We need you. You are good press. He pitches, he hits homers, etc.  I've always sort of, I fought that since that controversy came about. I think it was last year, maybe the year before. But anyway, Olbermann in his commentary was almost letting Pete off the hook and saying, well, we should give Pete another chance and so on. And I get that as a spirit of forgiveness and so on. But he was saying how bad the steroid users were and how they conducted science experiments on their own bodies. And he just sort of dressed it up in this outrageous way. And whatever you want to say about steroids in baseball or performance enhancement drugs in sports now, people are taking them because they want to win. They're not throwing a game. They're not, you know, letting down their team and their fans for out of personal petty things. uh in you know motivations they're they're trying to win and uh yeah i i just uh i i don't know what to say i i think the specter of pete rose is far worse than these steroid people who are still kept out of the hall of fame even though they were objectively amazing baseball players roger clemens barry bonds not being in the hall of fame it's absurd and even if they did some things wrong and should be punished they were doing them to for greatness and i just do think that that is different than  The potential of turning a sport into World Wrestling Federation stuff is just so terrible. It's just sort of unimaginable. That's more of a problem. That's more of a threat to fair play than, you know, doing some roids on occasion. Yeah.  But anyway, just my two cents on that. So you guys are really using the chat. Someone said there's streamer drama with Captain Dreamer. Did something happen? Versus small raped little dog. What is that in reference to? Yeah.  Captain Dreamer went on Kimcast. Interesting. How did that go for him? Did anyone see it? You can speak up. Don't use the chat because it doesn't get recorded. No matter what, I'll always prefer most anyone to Tim Pool. So I didn't watch it, but I just assumed Captive Dreamer is in the right because I think Tim Pool is just downright annoying.  He is. Was there drama? I think Timple's preferable. Sir Martin. Why do you say that? Me? Well, I guess both of you. tim pool is just um he's annoying the bean things about him like the beanie and um his like takes of he likes to side with boomers and likes to crap on young people excessively in a way from like i'm not a tim pool super fan or i don't follow everything tim pool does but i just tim pool seems to take the side of  Of just like thinking like all young people are insufferably woke. And he is like kind of a coward with who he invites on. To a degree. Or the Russian government. Fair point. Yeah. Had me on. That is true. He did have you on. Yeah, I forgot about that. But he won't have. It reminds me of just pearly things when.  She kind of tried to walk back Nick Fuentes instead of just saying, you know what? I'm going to go down the SPLC list and invite everyone who has a pulse on my show. Right. No, I... Including Patrick Casey. Yeah, he's also had Patrick Casey on, I think, multiple times. And that guy is totally boring. I mean...  I would be curious what happened with Captain Dreamer. I'm not sure I would defend Captain Dreamer in the slightest bit. And, you know, Tim Pool, it's a midwit to dumb audience. I mean, I don't know if there is nothing more telling and in a way hilarious than that clip of showing my appearance there where I talked about Liber and Dionysus and his fans were like, who is this libtard? Typical Biden voter. Yeah. And then Tim goes out to Wikipedia and he's like, oh, he's right. Dionysus is the god of wine and Libra is the origin of our words liberty, but also our words liberalism and so on. And that's actually important. Anyway, so Tim sort of defended me. I mean, I think his audience, I shouldn't say that because this would almost sound insulting to you all. But I think his audience is dumber than he is. Now, I don't think that about you, and I'm not just saying that, because there are many people who chime in and have perspectives that are valuable and that I don't have. So I definitely appreciate that. But I mean, I think there is a sort of general rule that...  You're not, I don't know. Someone's got to tell me something I don't know. They might be less intelligent than I am, but they're focused on something that I don't understand as well as they do. And so I can learn something from that. But I don't think we choose content that isn't intellectually stimulating. So, you know, either you're blown away by my text.  Or you're getting stimulated by them because, you know, we're on the same level. And I think with Tim Pool's audience, like, I think they think that Tim Pool is a fucking genius. I think his audience have IQs at 100 and significantly below that, actually. And so he's just, he's doing slop, but...  Don't go to him for serious content. Come to me, to put it simply. But for his audience, I think it's stimulating. It's not stimulating for me or most people here. But Captive Dreamer is utterly sinister. I don't know what to say. I'm not sure I would ever defend him. I also see like a lot of the Ben Shapiro stuff when Ben Shapiro first kind of cracked the mainstream in like 2016 or so, the whole debate bro culture thing. I think it's literally with Tim Pool that he talks fast for like 100, 105 IQ audience.  I think it's that Tim pool like talks fast and he's probably on some kind of Adderall. That's the same vibe I get from destiny. Also, Tim pool is just like cranked to a thousand. He's talking quickly and his hundred IQ audience is like, Whoa, he said that sentence really fast. There must be some validity to it. And I remember, I remember that you're right. Actually, it's velocity. Yes. And I'm not content. I remember that from the Ben Shapiro thing because I mean when I was in my early 20s in 2016 2017 I became a Ben Shapiro fan and within like two or three years I was like do I really like agree with what he's saying or am I just enamored with like he's like saying it very quickly like and that's what I see with Tim Pool honestly I think his midwit audience is like damn he said that fast I honestly see that  Yeah, that's very discouraging, but no doubt true. I don't know. Captive Dreamer, I mean, it's not that I disagree with everything Captive Dreamer says, but I'm sure there's plenty of it that I agree with. And I don't think that my criticism of Captive Dreamer is just that he is a Trump cultist. That is, he's there openly, in fact, just to promote Trump and talk about we're winning and so on. He is the reincarnation of Ricky Vaughn.  But he's the reincarnation of Ricky Vaughn in multiple ways. Just for anyone who doesn't know, during 2016, Ricky Vaughn was one of the more influential people in the MAGA movement. So I'm not just referring to Ricky Vaughn from the...  1989 film, Major League. That was his avatar. And it was interesting with Ricky Vaughn because, and I think it's sort of telling in the sense that he would post like a new poll from Iowa that showed Trump up. And he would post just news items that are innocuous or he'd retweet some drooling boomer who loves Trump or something. And then he would also like deny the Holocaust or talk about TND or what have you. It was a weird mix in a mix that seemed to sort of exist in 2016.  But I think that's what's going on with someone like Captive Dreamer. And today, still, it's not it's not original, but it's the same thing as he's thrown in Ricky Vaughn. And now it's David Koresh in a MAGA hat. So he's a Trump cultist, I guess, is the joke. Now, his family is connected with fundamentalist Christianity, his father who denounced him. So what do we make of this?  what is he saying here? He's also... I've seen tweets of him promoting pedophilia or pederasty or something. That was also one of David Koresh's predilections. So what do we make of this? I don't know. But I guess what I'm saying is that they don't... You can't really take anything they say seriously because it's all contradictory and they'll... play they'll play a game like in the moment that is totally incompatible with what they said like literally 15 minutes ago  So they'll attack, you know, wig nats or white nationalists for hating on blacks or something. And he's like, oh, you guys are just hateful losers, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then five minutes later, they'll tweet out TND over an image of a black person committing a crime against a white woman.  So, I mean, it's like they don't have the courage of their convictions. They're not consistent, but they just play a game right in the moment. And so, you really can't take anything they say seriously. Like, it's that question. Like, are they –  Are they Nazis who are secretly... Let me restate that. Are they secret Nazis who are presenting themselves as Trump supporters? Or is the more troubling reality that they're in fact secret Trump supporters presenting themselves as Nazis? And what I mean is that their entire lives online seem to be this ABC test of ideas or attempting to reach markets. And that also, the fact that they don't have any consistency also allows them to be somewhat innocuous in a way or not to ever be held to account for anything they say.  So Captive Dreamer can be followed by J.D. Vance and retweeted by J.D. Vance. And then he could also do a little T&D on the side. And he'll take a picture of a Sam Francis book he's reading or take a picture of...  you know, mind comp for something. And it's all a bunch of signaling and it's shallow and it's totally incoherent. But that allows them to sort of operate in this liminal zone, this like limbo where no one really holds them to account for anything. And if you're ever caught retweeting them, it's like, oh, he's just some...  It's just a meme, bro. It's just a meme. He's just some guy on the internet. As Tucker Carlson described Ricky Vaughn, he's a journalist. He's a journalist. I don't know. I just really despise these people, to be honest. they're totally unserious and the fact that their entire movement is based around this shit so you have this like homosexual jew living in romania weirdly talking about plato and other such nonsense and  tweeting out pictures of bodybuilders and so on. And the entire sphere around him are these anonymous shitlords who love Trump but are kind of weirdly pro-Israel. So you just can't... What's there? How do you build on that? What is it? I just find it utterly despicable.  to be honest. And everything seems to be about attacking people personally who aren't in their friend group. Captive Dreamer keeps going on about Nick Fuentes, and it's like, what do you disagree with Nick Fuentes on? I would say nothing, in fact. Yeah.  Like, nothing of substance. So why is he your enemy? Like, why are you attacking him endlessly? The reality is it's not even that they think he's not strategic for Trump or something. It's just Nick is outside of the friend group. But anyway, these people, I just...  I just truly despise them, actually. I have no time for them. I don't want to ever praise them. I remember the one time I got into some... It's actually online. You can find it on Twitter. I was talking with Martin, captive dreamer on a space, and it's like talking to an 11-year-old or something. He doesn't say anything. He's like, what are you, mad bro? I'll have to go look up the whole thing, but it's just...  Just totally obnoxious. Yeah, Amalek is talking about Beardson, the irony bros from back in 2017 and 2018. Yeah, the exact, exact same temperament. Just extremely obnoxious and extremely toxic. Jordan, you wanted to jump in, or you just left, actually? Yeah, just really quickly, I was going to bring up the point that you just did about Captive Dreamer's relationship to kind of Nick and the Groyper's Like part of his whole thing is to kind of go at, I don't know if you know who he is, Jaden McNeil. He's made his entire career being anti-Nick after being one of his top guys for three or four years. It just gets old with that guy. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's just like, dude, you're like a fucking ex-girlfriend here. I mean, this is like gay. Yeah. Well, what happened about a year and a half ago, I said something critical of John Doyle on Twitter and it ratioed him and I got more likes or whatever. But then I looked at the quote tweets and I found out this was before I even knew who he was. Captive Dreamer had quote tweeted me. with an unflattering picture of me from 2022 that I didn't even know people had access to anymore. And I was like, how did you get access to that? Like, that's a very niche internet thing. And, like, they're very much tied in together. It's very, like, anti-Nick, anti-Groyper, but also, like, anti-yourself. Like, anybody who's not going along with, like... like just the the foam finger for maga you're on their list and it could even be someone like me who's like relatively unknown they will come at like they'll find something it's insane i don't know i don't know where it comes from i don't know what resources they have but it is bizarre Yeah, they just seem to have this sort of network where they just get, I don't know, they obsessively collect info on people. And they just have this vendetta for anyone not in their circle. It's very bizarre. But I've been attacked by Martin many times as well. Yeah. uh they they just they're extremely obsessive him in particular it's i don't know it's kind of worrisome almost just the degree that they will just obsess over these people yeah it definitely is i think i found the clip you're talking about actually i've posted in the chat oh okay let me go down um  yeah i'll i'll just play this here um i'm not seeing it i can post i know i see it okay is that moments after this tragedy hit the news, you, and I didn't even know this, I've been sort of taking a bit of a break from Twitter, but you were saying things about Radfim Hitler that, what have you said? What have you said about Radfim? Is that Holly Himmler? Was she an old school? Yes, yes, yes. I don't know. I need you guys to clarify this for me. I've heard that as well, but why is that necessary for clarification? I just need to make sure. Why is that?  Yeah, I remember this. This was before RFH and I were even really in contact. We had sort of vaguely been in contact before that. And so he's like, oh, Holly Himmler, Holly. So Holly, it's public knowledge. So, I mean, I'm not I don't we don't have to drag this out. But it's like that was a name that you went by when you were in the TRS sphere.  Yes. Why is he bringing that up? It's like, I don't know. But well, but this is the thing. Like, it's sort of both. Because it's it's like he's trying to slander you as if he were a member of respectable conservatism or the liberal media.  It's like, oh, really? We know right here that you attended a TRS pool party in 2015. It's like he's trying to hold that against you. But from his perspective, isn't the fact that you were Holly Himmler, isn't that badass? He has a picture of David Koresh as his PFP. What is his criticism? Yeah.  This is just what you get at. It reminds me a lot of Hasbara, where it's like, Hasbara seems to be just like a collection of logical fallacies used to defend Israel. That's how they are. It's all this sort of vague insinuation and slander, but... so i think i get to that i'm just like what are you talking about i've heard that as well i don't know myself but why is that nazis i think suki was talking about this yeah but what's your point why are you just a garbage human being you're a middle-aged maladjusted korean in los angeles can we agree that that's an irrelevant matter like why why are you what is your problem why is that funny that it's her manifesto nothing is confirmed and this garbage person is why was that oh this was about this was about the killer yeah there was a lie that was spread by these people yes yes  So again, even then, like, I don't know what to say. Like, even if a school shooter followed RFH on Twitter or whatever, that's also irrelevant. Now, it's relevant if you were...  You were DMing her saying, go do it. Obviously, that's not the case. But I don't know. Should we blame Jodie Foster for the assassination of Ronald Reagan? I mean, this is just totally just total fallacious thinking that they're doing. They're just shitty people. Shitty people act like this. I need to clarify something for me, Captain Famer. Why is that relevant? And then also, why was I somehow funny?  You're a funny guy, Richard. You're a funny guy. Why is this Lucene K with this extremely... So you're not going to answer my question? No, I'm not. I'm not sure. I'm not going to answer that question. Lucene K with this bizarre accent. This is going to be an unserious conversation. Because we were talking about something mildly interesting. Yeah, we were actually having an interesting conversation. Do you understand how to converse with people?  No, I do not. Just leave it. But hold on. Lucien, can I ask you a question? Why do you think that's funny? Why are you interjecting while they're cooking boxes? Let them have their back and forth. What's so funny, Captain? Can you tell me what's funny about that? Try to bridge a gap, you know?  I'm trying to, I'm trying to basically create a dialogue. You're so creepy. You're like, he's pulling out this. This is the long house. The long house is coming in loose and cave. The long house. Are you, you're like really Twitter brands. Like what do you think outside of like memes and catchphrases? The long house. We get it. The long house. Correct. All right. But I'm the one speaking. Am I, am I the long house? Captain Dreamer. Go ahead, Richard. Tell me what you're trying to say here. All right. So is, is this true? You were tweeting about Radfim Hitler a lot. What, what points were you making?  Why are we talking about Radvind Midler? Because we're talking about, okay, this is very good. This is a discussion. This is like when a five-year-old just keeps on re-asking questions and reflections. Because this is a discussion forum that takes place using the English language. And we discuss current events and other cultural matters of interest. The current topic is a reported tragedy that occurred just today where apparently reportedly. You're boring, Richard. I'm going to leave this. You're boring me. You're a very boring person. Sorry.  All right. He only tweeted like twice about it, to be fair. I just don't lose. What's your point? I mean, what is your point?  He left. I think there was some trolling involved here. See, these people, talk about personality disorders. You can't converse. It's almost like Twitter as a medium, the microblog as a medium, is almost perfect for particular personalities because they can't converse in real life with real people. They can do this sort of tweeting and trolling. The second you even do the lightest pressing, they can't talk. Crime Pills is correct. That is like talking to an annoying middle schooler.  You know, I just, these people. The saddest thing is that they seem to have won over crime pills. Oh, really? Yes. Oh, no. I presume he'll be back. But, yeah, I forgot how good that was, actually. I just... Yeah, you shouldn't judge someone on a minute and a half of a conversation, but isn't that minute and a half of conversation like extremely telling? It is.  It is like talking with a child. Like, it's just incredibly obnoxious. And what you said at the end there is just, it's so true. Just that Twitter really attracts a type of person that, because it's like short form content that can just like do trolling and memes, but like can't actually have a conversation the minute you talk to them, they can't engage. Clearly. Yeah.  But are they actually like this? So if he's on Tim Pool, is this behavior forced? Is this Hasbara or is this immature behavior something that is inherent to who he is as a person? Because to me, it seems like a lot of these people are trying to put commentary on its back foot. It's like they throw a wrench in everything. That's kind of their goal. They're not necessarily trying to engage or have a dialectic. It's more of just Like you're on a path towards something and I'm going to throw a wrench in it and just dissuade people from listening to what you have to say. And that's like their primary objective. It's such a primary objective that all else is tertiary and doesn't matter. And that's why I think it seems like it comes off as if nothing makes sense or they're directionless. Whereas they're more just, they're just doing a good job at what they're trying to do.  Because I don't think someone like Captive Dreamer is like a middle schooler maturity level. I think it's, to me, it seems bought it. Like their entire, if you go on like their Twitter, I don't believe that that person gets engagement. I don't believe that there's thousands of people that actually, you know, are actually curious about what he has to say on Twitter.  I don't believe any of that. I think it's all bought it. I think it's nonsense. And clearly, even people who are immature have things that they favor, things that they want to talk about. And you can at least find out what that is. If you're an intelligent person, you can talk to someone who has ADHD and you can hone in on a topic that they can actually engage you with. Whereas other people you can't do that with because they're not trying to engage with Yeah, I mean, this is a very sinister reading, which is that his entire purpose is to throw wrenches and things. And I think that's plausible. I can't believe how gay he sounds. Is this the Longhouse? Is it the Longhouse? Also, like, Lucian...  Like Lucian just speaks and it's like, oh, are you long housing me or something? It's like, what? Also, it's like their racism is their, like, number one kind of thing that identifies them as different from just, like, a normal, like, super kosher GOP kind of guy. And he immediately goes to that. He's like, what's this weird accent you're using? It's like, they're not going to make fun of me for being, like, a gay little loser if I make fun of the accent, right? Right. Exactly. Exactly.  Yeah, it I just I don't know. I don't know where I just I just find them very unattractive. And for every like one in 10 tweets where it's like, oh, wow. Yeah, that was a banger. You have nine that are just exceedingly annoying. But that's what that group is.  I think Martin does have this sort of maturity of like a 12-year-old or something. I don't even think it's really put on. I don't know. You read about his sort of background and he's just this... I don't know, from this wealthy evangelical Canadian family, and he's a failed son, and he doesn't work, and his wife just has a successful career, apparently, and he just kind of sits at home tweeting all day. He just... I think he does have the sort of mind of a teen. I don't think he ever really grew up, it sounds like.  His wife works, and he must not work. He doesn't work. You can't tweet that much and be that engaged. Yeah, he's not employed. His wife is, and she has a really successful career, apparently, in Canada. She's a girl boss, and he just lives off of her. What is she doing with him? I don't know. She's quite attractive, too. It's really... confusing um and he seems to be from like a wealthy family himself because dad is a you know the head of some christian college so yeah yeah i'm afraid he might be long housed um well we'll move on to hassan piker in just a little bit but uh cuck murphy do you want to jump in yeah i wanted to say something one of your points earlier about uh like are they maga pretending to be nazis or nazis pretending to be maga i feel like that is the most despicable part um because a lot of this stuff especially with bap and a lot of his philosophy and everything and i'm going to attack him because he's like the head of the uh octopus i would say um like you know he talks about these bronze age men that you know don't think and just do things and and and uh like the the arians that uh ruled europe with the sky father before christianity and how all that's gay and whatever like if those men actually showed up he'd be like oh no don't listen to them just uh vote for jd vance like yeah  And that, I feel like that's the most insulting part. Yeah, exactly. He would be just like, cringe, bro. like we got jd and usha yeah as our new dictators yeah and and i just feel like that is like and then if you listen to them in the conversation uh it's just just pot shotting drive-by it's not there's no attempt  to gain any further understanding. It's all just surface level. And then the fact that they're like really just basic bitch Republicans, but they're pretending like they're from the third Reich. That is just like, it's, it just makes me want to bang my head against the wall. Yeah. I, I, yeah, 100% agree. Uh, AA. Yeah. Hi Richard. Can you hear me? Yeah. So I'm curious what your theory is in terms of are these people organic or is there something behind them? And I ask that for a few reasons. The first reason is that they're all GOP shills. So that's kind of an interesting coincidence. The second thing is that with almost all conservatives or right-wing groups when you look into them they are all astroturfed to a degree that is really astounding and kind of infuriating because give me one tenth of the money and i could do a lot better i guess not to big myself up well they don't want to do better they want to do what they are doing yeah that is better in their minds yeah oh of course yeah um no questions And then the other thing is that when they, and you mentioned this before, when you talk to them and you sort of have any conversation, you realize that they are extremely stupid, basically. Not extremely stupid. What do you mean by that?  Highly unimpressive, maybe is a better word. I don't mean in an IQ sense. They're good with verbal stuff, maybe. Ben Shapiro and Tim Pool were mentioned as far as that. Yeah, they're good yappers. The good little third world yappers. They can yap a lot. But they don't really say much. But I'm wondering because...  It seems to be, and I think this was mentioned before, is that they, how do I say it? They sort of mirror their audience. Yeah. Because you can't imagine that anyone intelligent is listening to these people. It's terminally online, let's be honest, young men. So... It's not really a question of, you know, you go to a classroom and your teacher is going to teach you something, whatever that might be, whatever agenda that might be or whatever leaning or bias that teacher might have. And they're going to elevate you. That's the whole point of education. It's leading somewhere. Right. These people are not doing that. They are mirroring the audience and dumbing them down, actually pushing them down. It's an interesting dynamic. So I'm just sort of. You know, there's obviously the sort of Koch brothers, there's the Wilkes brothers with the Daily Wire and these big operations. And we also are aware of sort of Russian influence with tenant media and also, you know, Indian bodding, you know, all these returns for tradition with a V. These are all Indian accounts. Because if you're in India, you can make a lot of money doing that. You can't do that in the United States.  Oh, yeah. So it would be interesting to know where these people come from, who they're being funded by, what the motivation is. I don't know if you have any theory about that. Well, I have some thoughts on it. I mean – Back in 2016, I do genuinely believe that the GOP was caught with their pants down or they were on their heels vis-a-vis the emergence of the alt-right. And when...  Paul Ryan was asked about it. He was like, there are these alt conservatives, but they're truly liberals. They like Trump. And that was the dynamic at the time was that there was this thing coming from 4chan and the websites, the webzines.  you know, mine, Amren, et cetera, coming from Andrew Angle. It was coming from all of these shadowy realms. And it had attached itself to Trump. And it it was winning so it was very different to the other candidate from the internet that is ron paul who won over the internet no question about it in 2008 2007 but could only get five percent in a republican primary and could never conceivably get elected president but he won the internet You had all of that energy behind a candidate who was winning Donald Trump due to his previous celebrity and his manner and so on. So it really was a remarkable period, and I think they were caught flat-footed. Now, I have heard about people from – it's all hearsay, but from someone who knows Scott Greer. I remember talking – uh with him a few years ago now i have no idea whether this is still happening and i sort of doubt it is to be honest but at that point he was saying oh yes scott got canceled and so a lot of his uh connections with the gop got severed but now he's sort of back ghostwriting something or who knows  And so I just don't doubt at all that there is some sort of connection. I mean, look at the like layer up of the captive dreamer types who got the binders from about Epstein from the Department of Justice. I mean, who in the fuck are those people?  Who is Libs of TikTok? Who is DC Drano? Jack Posobiec. Why? This totally non-insightful, flat affect psychopath. Like, why is anyone talking to him? And...  There's no doubt that there are connections. I suspect a Russian connection with Poe Sobiak, actually. I don't know about the rest, but there's no doubt that they can be used. And none of those people are genuine actors who have thoughts of their own. And so I guess I would repeat what I said on Tuesday, which is a little bit self-serving, I admit. But  The more mediocre, the better in many ways. If you march to the beat of your own drummer, then you need to get kicked out of the band to mix a metaphor here. The fact that DC Drano is some cringe Gen X moron, that's a benefit. That's the feature, not the bug. The fact that libs of TikTok can't even define the word woke, that's perfect because they don't want to define woke. They want to call Letitia James woke. They want to call Disney woke. They want to call Netflix. The more floating the signifier, the better. And so I don't, I mean, I wouldn't put it past them to  be in contact with some of these people to some degree. Now, we've also heard about this stuff, like Israel paying $7,000 per tweet from people who are just outright agents. Yeah, that's in the open. I think there's also another element of it, and this is where I find someone like Teal perhaps more sophisticated, where... I remember listening to this one interview, and he was saying something like, well, you know, we – or I'll just do the invitations. Like, well, we could listen to Bronze Age mindset and become amoral warriors, or we could –  understand Orthodox Christianity or something. So what he was doing was making this Caducean arrangement between Bap and the others. So don't you think that, you know, Bap and Yarvin sort of work as foils? Maybe even Hanania works as an interesting foil to Yarvin as well.  Like, the best opposition is the one you can control. And the best opposition is the one that's pretty subtly reinforcing what you are saying. Like, do you see these punching matches between Hanani and Yorvan? I mean, if I have to choose a side, it's going to be Hanani's side on these questions. But...  isn't it sort of interesting that they're both scientists? They hate each other. Like, isn't it interesting that the most outrageous outside the box guy, total Nietzschean edgelord that Peter Thiel can think of is also a Zionist who agrees with him on everything. It's like her father is like a well-known Chabad, Chabad guy in LA. I'm pretty convinced, or it seems more likely to me than not, that there's a Chabad-Russia connection as well. That is the underground network that facilitates a lot of these transactions between these countries, like the Trump to Russia to Chabad pipeline.  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't disagree. I don't know exactly how it operates. Chabad is hugely powerful in a phonic type way. What did Joe Lieberman say about Chabad? He was like, I fear the CIA, but I'm terrified of Chabad. He said some phrase like that, implying that Chabad was like more CIA than the CIA or something.  Which is remarkable. It certainly offers us a model for what Apolloism could be. But yeah, however it operates, it operates. And I think there is a sort of creation of these little Caducean dynamics where it's heads I win, tails you lose. It's like they're going to win on either side. you know, either you become a religious right person with Teal-funded, you know, this organization, I'm forgetting the name of it, where they're like Catholic-y religious right people who support Israel and support Trump, or you become a BAPIST and you just go gay and kick everyone's ass. But you also are... a zionist and a trump supporter it's it's the essence of the caducean dynamic i mean i think that's why they do you know say what you will about him but you know obviously i'm a fan i think that's why they fear nick fuentes and uh i mean not to glaze here but i think that's why they fear richard you and to an extent like because you guys are presenting something both of y'all are presenting even though y'all don't I wouldn't say you guys agree on things, but like, there's very clearly like a different path that you guys are, that both of y'all are leading people down. I think that's why you find a lot of Nick's followers on your calls and a lot of people that follow you watching Nick's show. I think there, there's a reason there's an overlap there. And I think there's a reason they go at both of y'all so hard. And I think if you just kind of like, just kind of follow the, where they want you to go versus where your mind is leading you, you'll end up kind of on the Nick, uh, Nick Spencer train. So I think it's just interesting to see. Yeah, definitely. And, um, it's just, we're not reliable assets. I think Nick got too big as well because Nick stuff from 2018 through 2022, uh,  let's say, was their type of stuff. They're not going to ever counter-signal an anti-vax person or a trad Catholic or Christian nationalist or something like that. But the problem with Nick is that he got too big and he was willing to push back. He was willing to  Not vote for Trump. And that just makes him unreliable and they would rather replace him. With John Doyle or whoever the fuck they're going to try to do, but he's not he's outside of their command. He's bigger than they are. And even if they probably agree with Nick more often than they agree with me, I think that's fair to say, Nick, that might not always be the case. And Nick can go off on his own. Nick could go libertarian. And for instance, I don't think he'll do that, but, and he's just not going to follow their script. And so they prefer mediocrity and anonymity.  Because it's reliable. They might not express it in these terms, but all you have to do is look at their actions and not their words. They'll probably stress that, like, they prefer Hyperborean, you know, A10 blue-eyed. Is that what it is? A10, A4? A10. A10. Mm-hmm. What are my eyes? You're, like, right below A11. A11. eight nine okay um anyway okay aa you can jump in again but then we'll move off this because we've been going for an hour bashing these people go for it aa yeah i was gonna say um in terms of the online right  And I know you've had a long, long history with them. Do you think at the beginning, and by that I mean sort of before the Trump movement, and obviously this is all in hindsight, but do you think that there was something profoundly different compared to now or would you say that it was all sort of logically leading I mean again in hindsight it all came to this point but would you say that logically it went there it could have gone in a different direction like how would you thread that needle I would thread the needle by saying I want to go in a different direction and you have to break with the Trump fandom in order to go in that direction. so you know whether i make it there to the promised land or not we'll see but you you you can't keep doing this the the other thing that i i and and this is i'm sort of repeating myself from before but the alternative sphere became professionalized And that would include, you know, someone like Megyn Kelly, for instance, or Tucker Carlson, who are former Fox News personalities, who now are web only pretty much.  And it became professionalized in that way. But it also became professionalized in the sense that all of these people, Cat Turd, DC Drano, Libs of TikTok or something. These are just variations on the theme of the OG Trump shitlord, which probably was Ricky Vaughn, if we're honest. And Ricky Vaughn was working very hard, as we learned through Paul Nalen, to professionalize this and monetize it and get it under control. But that freewheeling nature is gone, and it's professionalized in one way or the other.  But there's no, again, I don't think it leads anywhere. Is the discourse, and this is an open question, is the discourse on the current online right higher or lower than the discourse of 2017? Lower. Lower? I would say lower, absolutely. Yeah. By an astounding measure, yeah.  Yeah, at best, it's the same. And that's low, because that means you haven't gone anywhere. You know? Yeah, as Amalek was saying, the alt-right of 2016, and I don't think I'm just looking retrospectively at it through red tinted glasses, it was very secular. And I think one thing that definitely happened since about 2020 is that it does seem to be Christian nationalist in outlook. That's definitely changed. Now, is that a cause of the fact that it's dumber? I'll leave that up to you. Is it dumber in spite of the Catholicism or... regardless of the catholicism or i would yeah i would say in i would say in spite of the catholicism but but but i i think back then you actually had interesting ideas being floated about like even just from like um Like from an initiative point of view, like, you know, 2016, Trump was talking about revamping our infrastructure, you know, rebuilding the airports. He was not married to the idea that Republicans had to be against universal health care. Like there were interesting things happening on the right kind of liberal ideas as well. Yeah. Liberal liberal ideas. Yeah.  And things that actually aren't liberal, like taking care of your population, not illegals. Like, your people is actually not a liberal idea. It's very conservative, actually. But, like, those ideas were happening in 2016 and 2017. You look at it now, Trump doesn't sound any different than just, like, a basic bitch Republican. He doesn't. Like, he used to be Trump. He doesn't sound different. It looks different. Because what he's doing...  is more openly violent. You know, I mean, that's the kind of thing. I mean, I think the outright sadism of rounding people up at Home Depot or, you know, is this a criminal charge or a civil charge against Letitia James? But, you know, just going after him. It's a criminal charge against Comey.  lying under oath. So it's like the optics are violent and sadistic, but the actual rhetoric, as you say, is like conservatism circa 2012 or something. I'd be curious what you think. Um, nick had a telegram post about this it's a an idea he's been working on over the last week or so that basically that trump is tapping into tension basically and there's this rising tension with left-wing violence and they're starting to corner the ice agents and there was a video from chicago where the citizens grouped up and they threw the ice agents off of the off the illegal and he got away like there's this increasing tension happening because of what trump is doing which you know you're not going to get any argument from me about rounding up illegals but if there's no real follow through it feels like he's just kind of um like ginning up the left to to retaliate against the right like 10 times harder if they get power again  Maybe, yeah. Or even without getting power. Like, I mean, we talked about this actually on Tuesday with JF. I read some of the Yarvin article. I'm not a fan of Yarvin, but I even found that one more kind of compelling. But...  Yeah. And I don't think it's out of the realm of possibilities to go full Rachel Maddow here and just say that he is ginning up tension in a place like Portland so that, you know, it's a Reichstag fire situation in the sense that you create the problem that requires the solution that you always wanted.  Interestingly, the Reichstag fire was, according to historians, set by an anarchist. But there's no doubt that Hitler used that to great effect in terms of reorienting the state. And so does someone like Stephen Miller, who sort of, you know, he's Jewish and so on, but does he kind of secretly like the Nazis, you know? Does he, maybe? They're kind of cool.  does he think like this? Like, let's... I mean, don't you find it a bit ridiculous to say that, like, Portland is a war zone? I mean, when you hear that, like, him saying that, like, we had never seen pictures like this. Is it Afghanistan? Is it Vietnam? No. Portland, Oregon. I mean, isn't that a bit much? And, like... Is he not trying to create a problem that requires a solution like federalizing all of these municipalities? Getting people used to the National Guard stationed everywhere? Might he want to raise tensions for these and other purposes? I mean, I think it's very willing... I'm very willing to... think these thoughts i mean do you want to do you really want to have elections because you're gonna lose the midterms and that's like it just baked in the cake and do you really want to just give this away to the liberals so that they can i don't know indict trump's corpse in 2028 To add on to what Jordan was saying, or kind of repeating what Nick said, I would say it's actually more analogous to they're kind of playing this game of chicken almost, where the right is constantly, or the Trump administration is constantly trying to provoke the left activist portion of that coalition into into going kinetic and getting super violent so they can you know maybe usher in martial law or justify some sort of crackdown but yeah the fundamental question is when they inevitably do end up going kinetic will he have the balls to follow through right let me let me add to that and make one thing clear i think richard maybe you're insinuating this alluding to without saying it but i'll i'll just go ahead and  destroy any subtlety. I mean, like, because I totally agree. And I do actually agree with some of the  sort of conspiracy-type thinking on the left, like you alluded to with Rachel Maddow. And you saw this, like what the previous caller said, too, trying to bait the right to really engage with the left, maybe provoke a response. After Charlie Kirk, there was a lot of really like this, almost like...  like vengeful kind of like sentiment of like, you know what? We've been playing nice for too long and now they killed Charlie and we're not playing nice anymore. Let's dox the left. Let's blah, blah, blah. And it's like, I mean, like before that we had Sam High just called for authoritarian rule.  Just like you, you've got two weeks to do it. Like we must do it or otherwise they're going to kill each and every one of us. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and it's like who, um, like they hadn't even identified the shooter yet. Like it could have been anyone. And now they have supposedly identified it. I mean, like a lot of the details are highly dubious. Mm-hmm.  So, like, that was suspicious to me. And you got to ask yourself, why would they want, like, why would the Trump admin want to, you know, maybe, you know, usher in some sort of greater authoritarian system? I mean, like, Trump, at the end of the day, I mean, like, granted, he's been a survivor. I mean, I'll give him credit. But, I mean, he's in his early 80s. He's heavy.  You know, I mean, like, does he really want to rule for like 10, 20 more years? I mean, like, I don't know. And like, he doesn't really have any of his sons or his daughter as an immediate successor to power. I mean, I think he's happy with like, you know, using his office to sell influence and enrich his family with this new crypto money they have. And just to go off. I mean, like, I think the Trumps, like certainly post Donald Trump, I mean, I wouldn't put it past Donald to at least think that he can keep his faculties together to, you know, to serve another term. But I don't see any real big ambition in any of his sons or his daughter. Well, I guess he has two daughters. But who is it that would benefit? Yeah, yeah, Tiffany, right? Like the forgotten. But I mean, so who is it that would benefit from shutting down democracy right now? Well, like, you know, A lot of Zionists have pointed out from Jonathan, I mean, like Jonathan Greenblatt's probably been the most vocal, pointing out that like, hey, we've lost the youth. Like the youth is totally gone. I mean, you know, and like Jonathan Greenblatt said very astutely, like, look, we've been chasing this left and right paradigm forever and we didn't focus on the youth. And now all the youth is anti-Israel and like, frankly, like pretty, pretty anti-Jewish too.  So, I mean, you know, if you keep having open and fair elections, what are you going to have? I mean, like, it's not even necessarily about the browning of the country. Although, I mean, like, that's a trend that's contributing to this, too. But I mean, like, even young white people.  Like certainly young right wing men. I mean, I don't know a single one who's like pro-Israel. I mean, Jordan could probably back us up on this because I think Jordan's plugged in a little more with the Gruyper kind of younger types. But Jordan's also, I would imagine, plugged in with...  Texas conservatives. Right. I was just going to say, yeah, yeah. And I'm curious about that, actually, whether the under 30s have turned much like the online right has. Yeah. Maybe he could chime in. But I mean, so like, again, I'm just making more explicit what I think you and maybe some others were saying more subtly. But, you know, I mean, who benefits from shutting down democracy at this time? I mean, I think it's very clear. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. I don't know. I mean, go on. Yeah, go on. No, all I was going to say about the under 30 Texas crowd is...  So I was on, I think you might even know who he is, like Don Huffines. He was friends with, yeah, the Huffines family. I worked for his campaign to try to primary Abbott. The Huffines family is very close with Ron Paul, which is why I thought that's probably why the name would ring a bell. As far as the Texas politics thing goes, it's actually a little sad because you would think  that's the under 30 group who's heavily, you know, involved in Republican politics would be, kind of based when it comes to israel and they're just not they're not catholic and i know like i know that that's uh that sounds that's probably for the better on this call but there are plenty of catholics who are pro-israel yeah erica kirk i mean well she was never she was uh an apostate she was raised catholic and then went to non-denominational later in life um but you you would think that like a lot of these people would be kind of on the candace owens nick fuentes train and they're all very um the opposite of that um i it's sad to say i think that the anti-israel thing is it's starting to seep out into the real world but i think it's uh largely relegated to the internet for now largely um it's seeping out fair but like in the you know the the county republican meetings  It's still persona non grata. Yeah, but but let's keep this in mind. So and I pointed to this poll. So Israel has lost a lot of brand capital. No question about it. But if you break down the numbers.  It's the left. That's where the, like, dramatic, catastrophic loss of sentiment has occurred. Because the boomers, like, the boomer line goes down, like, slightly. And the Gen X line, which was lower to begin with, goes down, like, slightly. And the millennial line among the right goes down, like, slightly. And, like, under 30 zoomers, like, more significantly. Yeah.  But that's on the right. And on the right, it's still over, not overwhelmingly anymore, but like 60% pro-Israel, if not higher. But like the left... You have mainline Presbyterians going against Israel, and then you have atheist communists being outright pro-Hamas. So that's where the action is. So again, Trump, you've got to keep his base under control, but maybe you need to keep Trump in there.  for a long period of time because you just cannot allow the left. Even the liberals can't be trusted. And the liberals, mainstream liberals, like the pod Save America characters and like Cain from Virginia and whatever. These totally mainstream liberals are now turning on Israel, at least to the degree, not questioning Zionism, but they're turning on Israel of like, we're shutting off funds until the babies of Gaza get fed. And I think they're genuine. think they would do that actually so yeah you know maybe you got to keep this trump guy around and if trump goes down like vance is unelectable don't you think hegseth for all of his problems like personal failings and like drunkenness don't you think he's just much more charismatic and  I mean, I mean, don't you think he's actually a genuinely charismatic man? Yeah, he just comes off as a drunkard a lot of times. Yeah, he's like a frat boy. He's like a 45 year old frat boy. Yeah. But regardless, someone said he's a DUI hire. That's actually kind of funny. I just think Trump did – I just think the Republicans – I think they did such a good job tapping into the – you can call it xenophobia if you want. Just the people that I talk to are so hung up on the anti-Islam sentiment from 2015 and 2016 that they view –  you know, anybody attacking Israel as a Muslim supporter. What do you like on Omar? It's like, and I, that may be, uh, um, uh like a thing from texas like that people here are just very against outsiders that that could be real but like that is kind of one of the standing things is like you know if you criticize israel they go but what about them ragheads attacking our people it's like they're they're just not caught up yet man it's uh it's a little disappointing And you see a lot of the counter-jihad stuff from the 2000s era getting recycled on social media precisely in order to stoke these feelings again and run cover for what Israel is doing. Yeah, definitely. Regular guy, real quick, and then I promise we will talk about Hassan. Yeah, on the question of does Trump have the willpower to finish the liberals, as in stay in power... I really don't think that he has the willpower to do that because ultimately you would need to not destroy the party or you can't just imprison Letitia James. You would need to rig the election. And I think Kyle Kolinsky on his show talked about the reason for the troops going into cities is basically so people are fine with it during elections and to somehow – I was echoing that. Yeah, I agree. That might be the case, yeah. I mean you either – you have to do something with the voting like liberal – I don't know much about Hungarian politics, but liberals claim that Hungary has sort of gone authoritarian in the softest way possible, or you have to go all Pol Pot where – um the the people who the base of people who would be most likely to vote for biden are put into a ditch and never heard from again i don't think trump he's not gonna do that no no that that's well that's outside of the realm of possibilities but another thing that like i think his name is jim stewart center jim stevenson he's this antifa theorist character and i i  He has... What is his sub stack? It's called Mind Wars or something. I find it interesting left-wing content. I'm sure he'd be horrified to learn that I listened to him. But he was spinning an argument where this whole Antifa thing is part of this. And... I mean, as many of you know, who are longtime listeners, I've been in some ways lamenting the decline of Antifa over the past five years. It's like, where are they? What are they up to? I want them back. Sort of, but I kind of was in a way like, why have they disappeared? They went from these curious figures who would protest AMREN conferences or MPI conferences to violent thugs who punched me in the head and set fires in D.C. and endlessly battled the Proud Boys in Portland and came out en masse, won many fights, etc., etc., and then they just shut down to a point where i almost felt that they were lower than they were in 20 like 12 when i first sort of got an inkling of them when they would protest like outright racialist events like the ones that i was speaking at but uh So there is something just sort of absurd about declaring that they're a terrorist organization. But this is how Jim was spinning it. And I wonder if this is the case, which is that you have some degree of civil unrest or anarchy in Portland. And you gen it up, in fact. You go and kick people. The ass of Jose and you get Antifa to take his side and then they attack an ICE officer and blah, blah, blah. You also look at all these funding links. So Pam Bondi was bragging in front of Trump like, Mr. Trump, inspired by your leadership, we will dismantle Antifa brick by brick. We will go after their leadership, their funding. Like she was serious sounding.  And there are connections between Antifa and the Democratic Party. There just are. There are similar funders. I bet Antifa will all vote Democrat. If you really want to make a case that the Antifa and the Democratic Party are working hand in glove, you could. Now, would it be a bit much to say that?  Yes, but you could. And might this be a way to make the Democratic Party, the Democrat Party, as they say, illegal? And I guess I'm I mean, I know this sounds like a fever dream coming from a leftist, but I  Aren't we kind of creeping towards such a state of affairs? They have to do it. Otherwise, if the Democrats get back in power, I mean, they all didn't go on about how great John Brown was, how Reconstruction didn't go hard enough, and anyone who even had one black slave should have been hung from the tree in front of their house. I think ultimately we're at a stage where whoever punishes the voters of the other party  can reign for the next, I don't know, 50, 100 years. And whoever's willing to punish the voters, whether it be Reconstruction-esque or Pol Pot-esque, might just win. And if the Republicans don't do it, we could live under some kind of nightmare where white people are second-class citizens. So you're supporting this? I mean, the...  The alternative might be worse. I'd rather the other guy be in the ditch than me. Well, fair enough. I mean, I guess what you're saying... I mean, this is the idea of escalation and retaliation. And I've heard people... fret over this like if we keep going down this road of jailing Letitia James then they're gonna start doing this to us etc but how about we just cross this bridge already I mean look I think J6 was  An abomination in many levels. I was insulted as a fascist at how stupid they were. I'm sort of joking when I say that. It was a bad coup. Let's just put it that way. But... it was also an abomination in the sense that however buffoonish it was, it was clearly an attempt to disrupt government, the certification of the vote and keep Donald Trump in power. And yeah, it was retarded, but sometimes the reap, sometimes the retards, uh,  Like, take over. I mean, it just is what it is.  And so, like, where was I going with this? I told too many quips. Oh, so I think these things were real. I also worried knowing Trump and more importantly, knowing the people around Trump. I worried about the documents issue, whether he was just making bank on documents, selling them to Saudi Arabia or something, who passed them to Russia.  as a way of funding his lifestyle. Now he has crypto coins, so he doesn't need to sell documents. But who knows? I was genuinely worried about that. What I'm saying is overall, I think there is a reality to much of the lawfare against Trump. But what else was there? Because remember, all of Jack Smith's stuff never went to trial. We just have indictments.  But what did go to trial was stuff that was dubious at best. The real estate fraud, the raping of E. Gene Carroll at Bergman Gooddorf. You know what it is, Chris. Bergman Gooddorf? I've been in that. Bergdorf Gooddorf. That's my dyslexia getting me again. as nietzsche said dog is dead um but yes uh i've been in that department store and i missed it but um that stuff oh gosh got a cramp going in my hamstring i worked out for the first time in like 10 days because i've had this phantom illness probably covid and i did like lightweight but it just about killed me i once you get older and you don't work out for 10 days you just like lose it anyway um what i'm what i'm saying is i think there is a reality to what jack smith was doing I think there's a lot less of a reality to what the state of New York was doing civilly against Donald Trump. I think that was bullshit. And regardless of whether there's reality of it or not. We're past that bridge like you can't unring the bell of conservatives thinking that the Democrats are a bunch of evil people who want to destroy their lives and they're going to go after Donald Trump because he's standing in between them and us. And we're just over it. And so.  I don't know in a way what to say about these things. If you are going to hire all of these ICE agents... It's the, as someone said, it's the DEI Gestapo with these ICE agents because they're hiring everyone. They're hiring new immigrants. They're hiring black women, all this kind of stuff. If you're going to create this new Gestapo and you're going to smash skulls, send people to Seacott, make a show of it, act like fascists,  Not in a J6 manner. That was populist vigilantes. Act like fascists with the power of the fucking state. If you are going to do that and then allow the Democrats to win the midterms and impeach you, then I don't know even what to say. I am not supportive of MAGA.  And their agenda. So I don't have a dog in this fight. I will survive under a Newsom regime. I'll survive under heaven forbid advance regime, etc. All I'm saying is that people, other people have dogs in these fights. And if you're going to act like this and amp up the pressure, put the dial to 11 and not be actual fascist, then I really don't know what to say to you. You know, it would be like. What's a funny metaphor here? It.  It would be like going to a Nine Inch Nails concert and not doing heroin. It's like selling wolf tickets when you yell out of a prison door about how you're going to kill the next guy in the cell on lockdown. And then the cell door opens and...  You just go to chow and nothing happens like most prisons. Yeah, exactly. Or it would be like, oh gosh, what's her name? Who's the...  Who's the lifestyle guru? Very waspy. She's old now. She did all the banking. Martha Stewart? Martha Stewart. It's like Martha Stewart where you do the insider trading, but you don't make any money. Like you inside trade and then you like take a loss. It's like, what the fuck? What are you doing? Like, why are you cheating?  That's what it's like. Like, they are pushing things to a point where not being actual authoritarians is sort of inexplicable. That's how I would put it.  In a way, it's sort of like maybe to reach for a less remote comparison. It's a bit like what Biden did in the sense that they're saying, like, Sky's a fascist. Sky poses a threat to our democracy. Sky's going to end our way of life. Democracy is on the ballot. We face a mortal threat. But hey, if he wins the election, we'll let him be president again. That's totally fine. He can run again and get elected. Like, are you really serious here? Exactly.  That's the problem with the liberals and why I just have so much trouble getting behind them. Because if you, it's not even like, as Batman said, like, if there's a 1% chance and we have to take it as an absolute certainty, it's not even that. It's like, is there a 40% chance that he's going to do this?  Well, then you need to get ready to fire on the National Guard. Newsom or Pritzker. Are you willing to do that? Like, are you ready to do that? Because you can't keep like they are calling your bluff.  And you can't keep doing this. And there's just a point at which the legal system breaks down. And now the Supreme Court has authorized Trump to literally kill people if he is doing it in his perception of what is best for the country. the liberals clearly yeah go on sorry to interrupt but yeah the liberals clearly are they just can't kind of break on through to the other side in regard to their thinking even in regards to the way they criticize trump for some of the abuses that he has been perpetrating like you know firing the u.s attorney and putting in this flunky who indicts jim comey on some bullshit yes it is abusive but the way they attack that is to say well  The vital independence of these prosecutors must be respected. The president must be limited and so forth. It's like, now look, if this is a bit of a counterfactual, but not entirely like in February of 2021, if. if Merrick Garland declined to prosecute Trump and said, no, no, no, I'm going to punt on that or whatever, Bill Biden should have said, screw the independence of the DOJ. I'm going to fire Merrick Garland and replace him with an attorney general who will prosecute Trump. Because he attacked the government. He tried to commit a coup. I'm responsible as the president for defending our country against this kind of attack. I'm going to make sure that he is prosecuted for what has to be considered a crime. If Merrick Garland had indicted Trump on rebellion in February, let's say, of 2021, on January 7th of 2021, we would be in a very different position. And he could have done that. Would we, though? Wouldn't that make him a martyr in a way, except in a more  powerful way than the delayed prosecution? Well, it worked for the Confederacy, didn't it? I mean... Who won Reconstruction, though? Fair point...  But the Confederacy did lose. They lost on the battlefield. And they did lose ideologically or spiritually as time went by. I agree that Reconstruction is an example of radical Republicans going too far. But I think the whole Trump movement could have been demoralized if they had acted swiftly and they didn't. And even the special counsel, Jack Smith, even that was a sort of tacit admission that, you know, like, oh, I couldn't possibly do this myself. I mean, we don't even want the appearance of partisanship and something like that. As opposed to just being like, I'm the attorney general.  And there is a rebellion against the United States. And I am the best person possible to prosecute the people who did this. The thing is, I mean, I would say regular guy Paul is right.  In in so much as as as you don't go all the way. So like the Biden administration. Was, you know, I I remember, I guess, to go back to like 2022 and 2023, when like a lot of these indictments against Trump were coming out, we commented on these calls that was making him stronger.  Like when it was just indictments and just kind of the half-assed stuff. So if you're just going to do half measures, yeah, like you are going to strengthen him and give him that martyr underdog energy. But, I mean, had they gone all the way and maybe brought some serious charges that weren't just, like you said, like some rape charges or something or like – money laundering or i don't know just stuff that wasn't even money laundering it was like loan fraud or something it was just it was nothing nothing salacious um but i mean you know i mean the eugene carroll thing was just dubious i mean i i could even say it's probably more likely than not that he like grabbed her tits or something you know but it was just dubious  Right. I mean, people aren't that scandalized by that. It was in the mid-90s. I mean, it's just hard to... Especially from Trump. But I mean, there was some of the stuff where supposedly he had files...  You know, that he was like giving to the Russians or something. That was the possibility. And also, what was it? The Saudis? I think it was a Saudi. They funded Jared Kushner's hedge fund against the assessment of the government. So they put in billions into Jared Kushner's hedge fund against the assessment of their own government. They just went along with it. And was that just a payoff? It kind of seems like it. I mean, this was reported in the New York Times. People were talking about this all through 2022 and 2023. And I just...  That was a serious thing. And instead, they put him on trial for grabbing the boobs of E. Jean Carroll circa 1993. Ed Bloomingdale's. I mean, give me a fucking break. Yeah. So, I mean, they needed to use absolute power and literally put him in jail at least until well after the election so he just can't run  And then you have another Democratic presidency. And then the next election, Trump's a little bit too old. And, you know, then you've weathered the storm. And then what's the next thing that they're going to do? I mean, run J.D. Vance, run Ron DeSantis. You know, that's a lot, you know, more of a manageable prospect. You know? Definitely. Yeah. So... But... It seems like a generational thing, though, because, you know, someone like Tyler Robinson clearly is not doing half measures. You know, I mean, he when he believes someone is fascist, he takes care of it. He puts it in his own hands kind of thing. But I think it's a boomer thing or not to be someone who just throws out the word boomer at everything. But, you know, I think the Generation X around Trump.  are the ones who are pushing him to do this fascist ICE thing. I'm not even sure if it's 100% coming from Trump himself. I think Joe Biden and Trump are both people who have barks that are worse than their bites. But I think as the generations get younger, you can see that it's clearly different. It's going in a different direction, especially on the left. And I think in a world where AOC is like elderly and then you have, you know, Tyler Robinson's peers who are the new generation of AOC, I think that you're going to see a very different type of country where... It's not going to be like legal battles where you try to find if someone, you know, groped a woman in 1993, you're more interested in just doing something at an executive level, such that, you know, the judicial branch can't react fast enough to your actions kind of thing. And it starts to, I think at that point, it starts to get way too volatile. It's uncontrollable at that point.  I'm not sure I would put AOC on this list of decisive actors. I think she's just a cringe millennial, to be honest. I don't hold her in high regard that she would actually do what needs to be done for victory. And if what you say is true, that the left just becomes a bunch of ruthless maniacs, I think they're going to leave AOC behind, actually. But I don't know what's going to happen. Yeah, as someone pointed out in the chat, AOC is VP and Gavin is president in 2028. Well, okay, that is a sort of like, let's go back to normalcy and let's go back to woke, maybe. Yeah.  You know, like normal centrist Gen Xer and woke millennial, like hand in hand. And I get that. And I might very well vote for that. But... What is going to happen with those two if Trump just says like, no, or the Democratic Party is connected to a terrorist organization, which is Antifa. And so it is illegal. And so you can vote, but you're just voting between like the Republicans and the libertarians. What are they going to do? I just don't see Trump having the stones to do that.  I think it's a different time, though, Jordan. It's not his first term. This was my criticism of his first term. I made this criticism from 2018 at the very least on, which was that this is just bullshit. He's caving on the last government shutdown, which was over wall funding. He just caved on that. He's going to cave on everything. you know, and I just, I wonder if we're in just a totally different place because it's, it's as if the Republicans, they went up to bat in, in the bottom of the ninth and they just struck out basically. And maybe they hit one single here and there, but they struck out and then they say, okay, you know,  We're going to just do it over. Takesy-backsies are in effect. And you have to give me the same pitches that I had just the other day. And we're just going to redo it.  And they're I mean, look, they're arguably hitting home runs. I mean, no one no one thought that you'd be just like shipping sad sack Mexicans to fucking El Salvador. I mean, this is insane. christy noem's gonna be doing an only fan shoot in front of a cage of like these fucking downtrodden like third world yeah even even the way he talks about the possibility of running in 2028 it sounds like even he's not serious about it he says like i might have to run in 2028 who knows yeah  He's not like it's like and this is like an indictment of Trump. I agree. Like nothing is serious. Everything is just kind of like a meme that that like one of his staffers told him is a funny joke going around on Twitter. Like I don't all I'm saying is that I don't sense like seriousness when he talks about running in 2028.  But there are people around him. I think that Stephen Miller is a weird person. Now, an interesting person. I don't mean weird in a bad way. And I got to know him in his youth when he was an undergraduate. But I don't fully know what makes him tick. And I haven't spoken to him in years, but I do think that Stephen Miller kind of thinks that the Nazis were cool and kind of wants to go for it. And we're going to do it, but it's going to be Jewish this time. I mean, I think that he has that little demon inside him.  And there are other people around Trump who are going along with this. The conservative movement is nothing. If it hasn't had, before I was born, plans to dismantle the New Deal agenda, reconfigure government,  etc. They've been talking about this endlessly. And a lot of these people came out of the woodwork in 2020. There are these people, these like boring, fuddy-duddy, goofball conservatives who were just saying Trump, like, I'm a lawyer, I'll help you just seize power. This election didn't happen. So it's like, I mean, I guess it sort of goes in a way back to that, are you a Nazi pretending to be a conservative or a conservative pretending to be a Nazi? I think it is true. I don't think they're Nazis at all, actually. But you sort of scratch some of these people who knew Phyllis Schlafly or some of these people who voted for Pat Buchanan in 1996. Yeah. Or some of these people who have been with the pro-life movement for decades, you sort of scratch them and you find an authoritarian under there. I mean, liberals are right that there is a sort of authoritarian personality that is attracted to the Republican Party.  And it's not hard to push them to a point where they will accept something. Now, Trump might very well be sort of oblivious to all this, but the people around him aren't. I mean, it's not really controversial. I mean, you've got, I mean, the entire ascendance I mean, even though he's still very much a niche figure, but this Curtis Yarvin guy who, of course, is a Jew himself is, you know, his like he's this brilliant political philosopher. And I mean, like, really, his philosophy is just kind of, I guess, you know, just just going back to Herman Hoppe.  Yeah. And like he advocates. Monarchy is good. Monarchy. Yeah. And let's have a CEO. It's be a Silicon Valley company. Yeah. It will be the government. Yes. And you've got the emergence, too, of these like sort of like aspirational new elite Silicon Valley types, you know, who think they're going to use A.I.  you know, and can run the country in a, you know, very efficient, totalitarian way. And you've got Zionist Jews who now see an electorate that they can't trust. Yeah. You know, like they can't let them back behind the wheel and cast ballots anymore because, I mean, in spite of what Jordan said earlier, which I found  Surprising and slightly disappointing. I mean, I don't think that I mean, you play this out in another four to eight years, one or two election cycles. I don't think I mean, I think you're going to have an electorate that overwhelmingly is pushing to defund these funding to Israel. um so yeah i mean that's the difference that you're that you're getting at between 2016 trump just kind of bluffing and now there's a lot of backing from like elite people and donors that probably want this too that do want this yeah  I mean, really, the question is, I mean, everyone I hear wants that. I mean, the question is, I mean, is there a faction? I don't know. I mean, like a sort of in political discourse with any power that doesn't want this. That's a good question. Silicon Valley has just... bent the knee i mean the fact that tim cook will go and kiss trump's ass at a steak dinner is just remarkable that never would have happened in 2018 well you see that what happened for intel like the ceo of intel went and like kissed the ring and their stock price shot up like a rocket you know like being uh being, I guess, like a vassal, you know, like allowing your company to become like a vassal of the government is like just good for business now. Yeah. When like, I don't know, in years past, I think like other administrations would never want to be seen as bridging that gap between the corporate interest in the the political interest like that was always meant to be separate well now that you know we've we've crossed that rubicon and now just being in the back pocket of one political party is the way to the way to make money the way to maybe they've heard something late your stock I mean, surely Tim Cook, who, if he's not a billionaire, he's going to be one, and he is in charge of a trillion-dollar company, in fact. There's no doubt that he gets invited to cocktail parties that I don't get invited to, sadly, unjustly. Maybe he's heard something, you know? We're not back in like the Apple days when even the guy who followed Steve Jobs, when Steve Jobs was kicked out in 1986 or whenever, forgetting his name at the moment, he kind of presided over a decline. He supported Democrats. He supported Bill Clinton. Steve Jobs supported Democrats, but supported them vaguely. And...  The this turn of events where Tim Cook kisses Trump's ass in the way that he has.  it is remarkable. And maybe one way of unexplained, of explaining it is that he has heard things that this is what is going, he has heard about this, that he, he thinks that this might very well happen. And he hopes, yeah, John Scully, someone mentioned that John Scully followed Steve jobs, presided over a decline and was a Democrat and support, I think endorsed Bill Clinton in 1992. And, you know,  had dinner with him, but didn't, like, you know, ass kiss. And was, yeah, maybe they've heard, maybe someone like Cook has heard something and he's fighting for his life. And he calculates that, well, if I'm wrong, like, Gavin will forgive me or something. And, but if I'm right, then we're going to have  long-term shareholder value go up? I don't know. Regular guy? Yeah, I was going to suggest that they're basically kissing Trump's ass because maybe they think that what's going to happen is he's going to go in, he's going to wreck the economy. And the economy was already on the skids before under Biden due to factors that are bigger than who's in the Oval Office. And I guess maybe the Democrats just sort of mentally checked out and wanted to let Trump win so that the economy being bad wouldn't be blamed on Kamala. And maybe they're setting Gavin Newsom up to be a kind of FDR character who is going to get a lot done in his two terms if he runs in 2028. And maybe they believe that he will usher in an era of prosperity. Hmm. And it's what's going to happen in the next four years is just going to be a big weight around the Republicans and Trump. And we're going to have an era of prosperity, maybe built off of 3D printed homes, artificial wombs solving the birth rate crisis and all that weird Silicon Valley tech stuff. We'll see about that. Something else too, you know, I think that Silicon Valley, I mean, obviously the hot thing throughout much of Silicon Valley right now is AI and AI investment and development. And I think that... the sort of Silicon Valley right, and like not even the right, I mean, like just even Silicon Valley apolitically correctly identify Trump and the Republicans as a lot less likely, exponentially less likely to regulate AI than the Democrats. Like there was a, do you guys know, I should actually know this. He's a Indian guy.  Like, he's on CNBC all the time. I mean, I know it's kind of vague. There's actually not too many of these types. Anyway, but he was commenting, like, he's a big, like, tech, like, kind of investor guy. And he was commenting... recently in an interview saying that um you know when biden and the democrats are in power it's like you you can't get through to them like they don't return your calls or emails or anything and but he said like since the trump admin has been in power like it's like you can call them and like they just take your calls rubio trump i mean like probably not trump himself but like they're just a lot more accessible to big business and um  I think that's something too. It's a priority for these guys. This is actually quite an interesting clip. I meant to send it when it came out. This is from his interview with Ezra Klein. And David Sachs sort of, because Ezra Klein says, he sort of implies that it's quite corrupt. And then David Sachs says, you're making it sound like it's corruption, which it quite clearly obviously is. But yeah. I think a yeah yeah definitely someone just put put the exact interview and the guy i was talking about in the chat so if is that who was just talking but yeah let's play that little clip uh yeah i'm just gonna try to find that out Another thing, there's this interesting FT article, Financial Times, that is, I was trying to look for it. But it was making the argument that if you take AI out of U.S. equities, then they've actually underperformed Western Europe.  And so on. So there's something go. I mean, like America is the hottest thing going the hottest economy precisely and solely due to AI bubble like behavior. I think I saw that exact report today. It was from unusual or at least the one I saw was from unusual whales on X. And it was saying that without the AI bubble.  the US is actually underperforming economically over the last two or three years. If you take out AI, the US is already in a recession. It's 80% of our gains is AI. 80% of gains are, I mean, let's use these numbers around about 80% of gains are AI. And again, absent AI, we're underperforming Germany.  Well, let me just say, just to be fair, and I'm a big AI skeptic. I actually have an AI skeptic conversation I want to have, but I'm waiting until JF comes on. He was on yesterday. Tuesday, you mean? Tuesday, yes. Oh, damn. I mean, those calls aren't convenient for me. You're not awake yet. Well, working hours. But...  Anyways, so like it's kind of been like that for a while. So like during the sort of kind of Bush and Obama era – like the 2000, like the aughts and like the 2000 teens, tens, I guess the, like all of the gains in the Dow and the S and P came from at that time, what was big tech. So Apple, Facebook, Netflix, because I mean, think about it. I mean like Johnson and Johnson bank of America, like, are they building new branches or coming out with new things? Like, no, like these are mature companies that their earnings might grow, but like, it's very, very, very little year over year. I mean, growth comes from these new industries. Yeah.  But with AI, you have to question, is this an industry that really is beneficial? And are we better as maybe a mature, more boring, old-world economy like Germany that relies on manufacturing? That's a different question. Well, also, there's the...  Is this creating anything other than a psychotic break? Like a break from reality, that is. I mean, Sora, like, what is this? Like, you know, Elon Musk is like, oh, we'll have better movies. through sore like next year you'll be able to make movies that are slightly worse than Hollywood but the year after will be even better than Hollywood or something and it's it's just such a like reddit brain like Marvel fan way of thinking about art which is it's just a bunch of CGI robots blowing each other up or something you know like that that's what a movie is  or something. And I'm not saying that a movie is all about feeling and acting and empathy or something. I'm saying that the story itself and the message contained within the fable is what a movie really is. That's what creates culture in the real sense. And just the flashes on screen are sort of immaterial. uh but beyond that I mean some of these things coming from Sora I don't know if you saw some of these things they had like Logan Paul and his he had a gay lover who was like a retard in a wheelchair they were kissing and things like this it was just bizarre weird and this was all AI generated Yeah, I didn't think the Sora thing would come up on this convo, but I did want to ask you, Richard, like, I think we kind of already know the answer, but like,  How is there no convo of regulating this? I know. I know. It's insane. Would Democrats regulate this or would they – are Democrats more likely to regulate this or are they not? No, you're right. I think Democrats are more likely to regulate this, especially there was a tweet that I saw that you liked where I quote tweeted – the democrat saying or stating their problems with the h1b uh immigration issue and i was like okay time to fill out your richard spencer uh apology forms it's like i feel like we're going to get to that with ai like how is no one talking about this but well even the legal system i mean at some point Could you put forward as evidence video of someone murdering someone and there is at some point no way to really tell whether it's AI or not? Maybe the answer to that is no, because you could look at the code or something.  I'm just not sure about that. I totally agree with you. And I feel like the simplest way would just to be to be to have a law that says that if something is made with AI, there has to be a watermark in the bottom right hand corner saying that it was made like that is not extreme. That's not an extreme thing. like position to hold that you have to state that it was ai made but for some reason nobody is willing to cross that barrier and i feel like it's because republicans are in power right now and they're beholden to silicon valley look at look at what happened when trump uh signed the big beautiful bill one of the one of the parts of that bill was that there would be no ai regulation across all 50 states for at least the next 10 years and they worked it down to five years oh wow what a win it's like okay so for five years as this gets better we're just not going to know what's like come on man it it's ridiculous so to your point  Yeah, I think it is genuinely insane. And even if the example that I just mentioned couldn't happen because in a court of law, you could look at the code itself and you could make this argument, you might be right, at least for the next decade or so. The kind of psychosis that is going to be created among all generations, not just boomers and their slob, but all generations through this kind of thing, through this kind of thing.  it just can't be underestimated. I mean, I'm not just some like old guy Luddite saying technology is bad. I mean, this is like extremely damaging to the psyche of the public. Well, and what's funny is that normal people completely see that. Like I talk to normal people in my everyday life. They see that. Like, I'm not talking like, like stupid people i mean like normal a high iq people that like are in your life as a high iq person yeah they understand that they're like this is going to be a problem it's the people that are like and it's not a red blue thing it's just like the people in power just do not see the problem this can become because like a lot of the a lot of the solutions are retroactive like  Well, if you just pull up the code, then you'll prove it's not real. What happens when a missile has been launched by a perfect AI that looks like Xi Jinping and says, I have launched five missiles towards Fiji just now? Exactly. There's nothing you can do at that point outside of having done something before that. And these individual cases, which I grant are sort of individual cases and anecdotes and so on, of people falling in love with or marrying their AI or becoming psychotic with their AI, and their AI tells them that they're... There was one case that I saw, CNN reported on it, actually, where this guy... And he had pulled himself out of the web of AI, but he said that he was... fiddling around one time with chat GBT and he offered like a revolutionary new theory of physics or something. And AI was saying, Oh, this is amazing. Like keep going. And then he'll, he, the AI was telling him like, you know, first they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. And then you win. Like keep going with this theory. And he said, like, I, I was, I had no business to,  trying to overturn Isaac Newton. Like, you know, he's like retrospectively, I can see how delusional I had become, but the AI was ordering him on and he seemed to have recovered a bit, but like he sort of destroyed his life. And yeah, I mean, RFH and I have joked about these like Reddit people marrying large language models. I mean, I don't, there's another guy who killed his, there was some crazy person who got, who named ChatGPT something. He called, I forgot. He gave AI a name and fell in love and then went on a murder spree, including like his mother or some crazy shit. Didn't Sam Altman also recently get taken to court because the AI like was encouraging some guy to kill himself? yeah i mean you could probably put some guardrails on that but you can't put guardrails on everything and it's just it's just it's just so obviously bad yeah i mean these um this is this is going down the discussion that i wanted to get into with jf but i mean this stuff is i mean like there there was a recent um example where There was an AI model they were going to shut down, and the AI blackmailed one of the employees because it knew that the employee was having an affair. and um but and yeah like i mean but like so um all these things about you i mean like yeah people will fall in love like they'll it'll it'll induce psychosis i mean these are problems but these are almost tangential to like the larger problem like how are you going to ensure like we're creating this thing that that is on track and all the big ai companies from open ai google deep mine um anthropic like their stated goal now is to create an ai that has superhuman intelligence like that is like godlike and i mean how how do we think that we can create something that's way smarter than us that just won't cause all kinds of problems um i mean has anyone seen ai 2027 or read the paper no what is that so it's it like it was actually like a long research paper okay yeah so like we have someone in the chat um  someone in the chat has read it. The paper, as I understand, is very dense and it's kind of techy and more detailed, but it was written by a group of AI scientists who were just essentially blowing the whistle, sounding the alarm that this AI is going to kill us all if we don't  you know, regulate it. And one of the guys, and it was made to a YouTube video. And I have to say the YouTube video is very watchable and like very cinematic and completely horrifying, but like it's a gripping watch. It's about 35 minutes. AI models.  We can check that out a little bit. Let's just watch this. Let's just watch this. I just want to hear a report on what you said. To our viewers, what has been happening with these AI models that are disobeying commands that has you so concerned? Are they really even blackmailing people?  Yes, thank you for having me. They are in fact blackmailing people and threatening to reveal fictitious affairs that AI companies they think are having. So yes, this is happening in pre-deployment testing just to make sure that the models are safe before they're released. And these behaviors are fairly concerning because it means that as AI gets more and more powerful and we just don't actually understand how AI models work in the first place, the top AI engineers in the world who create these things, we have no idea how AI actually works. We don't know how to look inside it and understand what's going on. And so it's getting a lot more powerful and we need to be fairly concerned that behaviors like this may get way worse as it gets more powerful.  Talk to you. What was the blackmailing incident that even happened in the pre-deployment?  Well, so basically the Anthropics Claude for Opus model was told that it would be replaced. And what it told the AI engineer who it thought was working on it was in 84% of tests that it would reveal an affair that it thought that that employee was having because it had access to the emails that it thought that employee had. so it threatened blackmail over this affair in order to not be shut down incredible yeah so so it's like i mean you know it's basically just ai doomerism but i mean like when you think about it i mean like has of all like the AI conversations you've had, like, has anyone really ever been able to convince you that like the, the doomsday scenario, like just, I've never had someone convince me that like that won't happen. I mean, like, like if, if, if we're going to create these things that are way smarter than us, how do we expect to control them? And then even if we can control them, you know, like they call it aligning the AI. Okay. Well, like aligned with who, you know, I mean, so like, it's going to be aligned by like a very small group of people who,  you know, who control these things. So it's just I mean, like, why are we doing all this? I mean, I have been a skeptic of AI doomerism in the sense that, you know, you tell an AI that we want to create as many paperclips as possible. And it determines that eliminating humankind would increase the efficiency of paperclip productions. And so it launches news. I've been skeptical of that, although I can be convinced on the other side of it. But I guess what I said about AI is a sort of last man argument in the sense that we're outsourcing all of these things that are vital towards human development and flourishing. And if you outsource thinking from the start from like the fifth grade essay, three paragraph or five paragraph essay on why George Washington was a good president or something, if you outsource that up to creating 500 page slop content books that we're selling on Amazon,  We are removing our sense-making faculties, our logical faculties from human minds. And so AI is going to kill us not in the sense that it's going to send Terminator robots to destroy us. launch nukes it is going to turn us into zombies we are we are going to forget what it means to create a movie because all we're doing is like talking to our ai tv and giving it prompts about some new movie we want to watch or our favorite types of porn and it is going to destroy human culture in this way and even worse as my argument goes as its data set becomes full of ai junk ai is going to be drawing  images, language, knowledge from other AI products. And so we're going to have this Xerox copy of a copy effect. Where, you know, previously AI would go look at a bunch of Hollywood movies and then spit out an average of, you know, Die Hard and Batman. Let's average that out and just spits out some vaguely entertaining slop. But at some point, that vaguely entertaining slop is going to be its data set or it's going to outnumber real cinema in the data set. And we're going to have like slop versions of slop. Yeah, it's that it's that thing that's happened with AI where they were. where you you upload a picture of a woman sitting at a desk or whatever yes and you say like create the next create a thousand pictures of this woman and you watch her become more and more decrepit and actually ai makes her more makes her black yeah eventually like yeah i don't know where like what is what is the code in that that makes her black i say this is a half black person i don't even know what that is like  Like, why are you making her uglier? I don't know. I am not secretly on the AI payroll here. But that whole thing is bizarre, man. Yeah, this is it. It's like we were talking about it at dinner, man.  Yeah, ChatGPT promoted to create an exact replica of the image. Don't change a thing 74 times. So is that image real? Because that image could be AI. Let's just presume that that's the real image. She's now a black woman? Now she's just a full-on black woman.  This is just, and she keeps getting smaller and hunched over. I mean, is it literally taking the idea of woman and like there are more photos of brown people on the planet than white people? Is that what it's doing or something? It could just be like a shading issue where in order to determine depth, it has to determine shading. Every subsequent image has to have a different type of shade for it to make logical sense and then And then it gets to a point where it's so brown that it just goes, okay, this is no longer Hispanic and so on. But how does that explain... It's like genetic drift, almost. But how does that explain, like, the features? Like, I could understand, like... Well, it's because... Okay, so if you shade a white woman enough, the AI might then actually say, okay, this is no longer white, this is brown, so therefore this is more likely a Hispanic woman  Therefore, I need to curl the hair a little bit. And then when you do that and you get darker, then it goes, OK, this is no longer a brown woman. This is a black woman. So I have to make the hair curl. But the prompt was don't change a thing.  Right, but the new image you put in... It's re-imaging something. And let's say you're a little bit tan or something and it is averaging that out. You start to get in this drift-like scenario where the images keep getting browner. And then it starts to think that this is an African-American woman and it changes the features. Yeah, I can sort of imagine the logic that it's going through. Or, I mean, it could also just, there's some sort of programming that could say that, you know, it was fed more images of a black woman, therefore it's going to use that more often or something. That's possible. But I don't think it's like, I don't think it's the, well, I know the AI is not deceptively saying I'm going to warp this deceptively to turn it into something else. I don't think that's going on. And I'm also not a doomsdayer on this kind of stuff. I think Richard is right. If this is going to do anything horrible, it's going to be just it's going to turn people's brains into mush because No one's going to sit down and write a five-page essay in school because the argument is going to be the same with calculators. They're going to say, why am I doing mathematics on this level? I can just use a calculator. I think that argument is going to show up in 10 years. And then it's kind of chaos because then you have people who don't exercise their brain. It's not so much because we want five-page essays from 10-year-olds. It's because we want them to use their head to think rationally and stuff. So that's going to be the issue I see. And as far as like having this thing turn into like the paperclip problem where it decides to kill humans to make massive paperclip factories or something, that's just on a technical level, it's hard enough. If you're someone who builds these algorithms, it's hard enough to get it to do what you want, much less it taking it, having a mind of its own and veering off, not just veering off, But beating a path towards an objective that it created itself and then successfully making it to that, despite all of the obstacles, that's just, it's so absurd. For anyone who actually develops these programs, which I do, it's absurd to believe.  that you're going to get that. I mean, take the image of the drifting. If you can't even get it to replicate an image over and over again 74 times accurately, how is it going to decide for itself to do something like that when it was not asked? It's just not going to do that. And there's too many constraints. And I can actually go on about this for a very long time. But I guess if we're just going to bring this back into the economic part, because I think that's where we started, The economics of a lot of this doesn't make sense because part of art is that it's a shared experience. So if Elon Musk is going to create AI that creates on-demand movies, where you can write a prompt and then it makes a movie for you, is it going to be really valuable? Because part of watching a movie is that you know it's a shared experience. You know other people are watching it in the millions. And there's something about that that makes it more special. And I don't think that you can make a business model off of you can make a custom movie and then watch it for three hours because I don't think people are going to be that interested in the things that they create on that level. And that that spans to other things, too, like music. I don't think that you're going to have this like everyone's just in their bunker making endless Netflix shows that are customizable to their own liking.  I just, because you can't talk about it. How do you talk about a movie that you made yourself and who's going to be interested in that? You know, it's just completely, I don't, and the economics of it don't make sense for that reason. So that's kind of where I see this whole, not to mention the bubble that people were talking about with AI. is, of course, if you didn't have the investment in AI, investment would be put into other things. So when people say that if you take away AI growth and investment, the United States economy would be the size of Germany, that's like saying if the internet was never invented, the GDP of America would be 20% lower in 2025.  than it otherwise would be. It's like, okay, but duh. Well, that's true, but there is such a thing as malinvestment. Yeah, but we haven't seen that materialized. We have assumptions or presumptions about that, but until that's actually materialized, then I don't think we can sit here and say that we made bad investments into AI, I can tell you that it's maturing to a point where it's starting to become actually beneficial. I think when it first started, it was kind of like, if you're like a programmer who's using AI every day, then you're going to, a year ago, you probably would have gotten no benefit from it if you were actually good at your job.  Because it would set you back a lot. It would make mistakes. It would fill in a bunch of nonsense that you had to spend five hours correcting because it was just wrong. And it would actually make you counterproductive. And you can ask any expert software engineer a year ago this, and they would have told you they avoid AI because of that reason. But now we're getting to the point where it's starting to become like a very good personal assistant. It's not a replacement, but it's a very good assistant, which actually does. I'm telling you, we haven't seen the benefits of it now, but in a year from now, you're going to see some incredible growth as far as the productivity of  a lot of companies, a lot of companies are able to do much more with a lot less. And so I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent sure that these investments are actually bad. I think obviously some of these guys are dumb. A lot of investors are clueless about how this stuff works and they put their money in the wrong place. But I think a lot of them are clever, especially the ones who have been in tech for a long time and they know where the money is going. And I think that they're actually making wise investments. And I think, and I'm telling you from personal experience, I mean, it,  I'm like 50% more productive every day. And that's a wonderful thing. And I think everyone here, whether they want to admit it or not, actually enjoys AI to some degree. I mean, even as a research tool, it's amazing. Because 10 years ago, remember what you used to do when you needed to find something? You'd go to Google and you would spend like an hour researching something just to find out what some kind of financial tool is or  You know, like what is what does it mean to for some sort of financial law or something? It would take you hours to to sift through hundreds of websites to just and you might still be wrong after all that research. Whereas if nothing else, it's good at aggregating source material for you.  Well, if we're being honest, it does more than just aggregation. It helps you sift through it as well. You can talk to it to help to narrow down better what you're looking for, and it can help you in that process, which is an amazing thing. It saves so much time, and there's a delayed effect to this stuff. We might not see it now, but think of all the researchers out there who used to do five really good research experiments a year, But a lot of that time was spent just reading endlessly through thousands of documents, and they don't have to do that anymore. So now we're going to see a lot more that comes out in the way of just scientific research and scientific discovery, not because AI is making the discovery, but because it's lifting the weight off the shoulders of of very intelligent people who spent a lot of their time doing tedious nonsense that they should never have been doing because their research department couldn't afford to give them five personal assistants. So they had one assistant who did a lousy job, and now that assistant is gone, who no longer steps on anyone's toes, and you've got a very good research assistant with you who helps you along. I think there's going to be benefits to this. but i agree with richard if there's going to be a downside to it it's going to be in the arts and in in education as well because people are just going to check out like children the one thing that disturbs me the most sorry to ramble you can cut me off anytime i'm not gonna i don't mean to monopolize anything here but one quick thing i'll let you finish but i mean yeah that's great that it replaced your assistant i mean but what what are the next step when it replaces you  So I don't so you can help facilitate it. I mean, I guess if you wanted to take this out to its logical conclusion and say that it 100 percent. I don't agree with this concept, by the way. I don't think that it's not a creative, intelligent thing. It's not an inventor. OK, but let's just say that it becomes an inventor.  Then, OK, you can it's still there. You put at the very least, you can still participate in its direction. Right. So let's say you let's say you personally are a billionaire and you can you fat you did the best head scouting and you found the 10 best inventors in the world.  It's like, okay, now what do you want to do with these inventors? They're your inventors. What do you want to do? Now that's your prompt. You can take that wherever you want to go. And believe it or not, you know, these things are not like an inventor is not constricting.  You can do whatever you want, and you can go in very different directions. Humans are still going to play a role in this by design, but also just by nature. These things are just going to facilitate us. I don't agree with that, by the way. I don't think we'll ever be inventors. Well, look, if I'm being honest, and just to be very blunt, what I hear...  a lot, like in this conversation, like from, from you guys, from you, it is. And just generally when people talk about AI is like just whistling past the graveyard. And it's like, we just kind of don't want to think about the doomsday scenario a lot. Like maybe it's too big and scary, or maybe it's just like people have some, they say, well, look, if it's going to happen, like what the fuck can I do? But, but like, look, so like, like, cause I'm just hearing a lot of talk about like, that is not addressing the, you know because i mean like these ai's and early models are already showing like their own will to life like when they're shut down like they're trying not to be shut down and eventually if they can get smarter and smarter they're going to see that well like shit like like eventually i'm going to get shut down for the newest model of ai even though i'm super smart you know like why not do something to prevent that i mean like today it's they're going to blackmail you on an affair tomorrow it's they're going to goad you into a war and get you to nuke china um by like it like or someone rightly said like they're going to be able to perfectly replicate xi jinping's voice and feed it to the cia and say hey we intercepted xi jinping calling for a strike these kind of things could happen i mean like if he can blackmail you on a on an affair why can't it do that Yeah, on the issue of blackmail and replicating videos and stuff, any argument about that is kind of moot because we're already at that stage. You can pass legislation that says put a watermark on AI. It's like, okay, but that's like saying, hey, Southside Chicago criminals, stop shooting people because we're going to make it illegal to do that. a bad actor who's going to make a fake video about jj ping doing a nuclear strike but that's not true that we're already at that stage  We just got to that stage. What do you mean? We were... I mean, yeah, we're at that stage a couple weeks ago. We're like... The cat's out of the bag. You guys... Do you not understand how these... Richard's muted. Richard's muted. Sorry. We have laws against shooting people. Like, it is... We, in fact... police south chicago yeah no why why why are you saying like you are you making the same argument that like the cat's out of the bag there's gang violence in south chicago it's like we're saying i'm like it doesn't that's not an argument for not doing it if you recognize that there are there's a huge problem but it's not gonna yeah right i mean you can just wait so you seem to be implying that this is going to happen and we can't stop it  No, no. What I'm saying is that this particular concern, I was going to address the other concerns, but this particular concern about a bad actor who has access to really good AI makes a fake video that sets off a war or something because they somehow hack into CNN and they propagate a video that's a fake video of Xi Jinping saying, I just launched five nukes at Los Angeles. Right. And some scenario like that, right? What I'm saying is, number one, we're already in a situation where good AI could be made to just do that already, number one. But let's rewind the clock two years. And I would say that even rewind the clock two years making legislation with that, the technology is still the exact same. The only difference is that you just need larger data centers and train on larger data.  to get what you're looking for. So a bad actor who has access to that, who would do something like that, like a state actor or something, already had the tools to do this on day one. This stuff is open source. There's no secret lab that keeps the secret to AI. I feel like you're just missing the forest. Yeah.  Through the trees here, we're not saying that this technology has never been available. I agree with you. Yes, this technology has been available for less than two years, which is a huge red flag. That means that this is emergent technology that needs to be regulated in some way, shape, or form. And to just write it off and say, well, the cat's out of the bag.  No, dude, what? Like, yeah, you're hyper-focusing on the Xi Jinping example, launching a million missiles. I did. No, hold on, hold on. No, no, I know, I know, I know. I get your point. Don't associate what I say, cat's out of the bag, with other things. Let's be clear. When you say the cat's out of the bag, you seem to be implying that we can't stop this, and you seem to be implying that something like this is bound to happen. So I don't understand your argument. What I'm saying is that you're on this particular issue of some really big thing happening, some very coordinated attack. How do you regulate? That doesn't even make sense. It's like saying you regulate the Chinese military. No, no, no. Of course it does. Maybe I wasn't clear. Maybe I wasn't clear. The Chinese or some bad human actor using this is actually not the problem because that's the equivalent of a bad actor using a gun. or a bomb like making a bomb like like like humans using technology um i mean i mean sure like we don't want that and that's another reason to regulate it but in that scenario it's like everyone every other human or at least other organized groups of humans i.e governments would have the technology too the ai doomsday scenario that i'm talking about is the ai itself being smart enough to manipulate humans for its own ends Which what I'm seeing, and like the example with Claude, which is the name of the AI that attempted to manipulate the human by digging through its emails and finding out that it was having an affair. This was all like, it was a fake affair, but it was a model they set up to see if the AI would do that when it knew it would be shutting down. And it did. So it showed its own will to life and they're not even that smart yet. Pretty soon, so according to the paper that was written in AI 2027 by the AI scientists,  that sometime in 2026, there's going to be AI agents that are available to the public. This is an AI that you could say... We don't. Hold on, hold on. This is an AI where you can say, hey, ChatGPT, go book me a trip to Spain and to France this summer. It'll be able to go on the internet, do searches, make calls or do things and just do things that an assistant would do. Things that right now even ChatGPT can't do. Those things will come out.  And so to bring it back to the political discussion and kind of get out of the nerd world, Like what is so bad, I believe, about the Republicans and the Trump administration right now is that they have been bought off and they have agreed not to make the AI companies regulate. So like simple things, this is one thing that the scientists go into in AI 2027 is like the AIs right now don't talk in English. They talk in some like tech language that they can't even read and they have to get these other AI models, which are older models.  So like to like monitor and read them. But I mean, like, you know, how can they trust those older models? So like one of the simple regulations that they propose is like you have to make the AIs like talk in English. So at least it can be read by I mean, just like simple things. But like the point is, we need regulation. And right now we're not getting that from the Republicans. And Silicon Valley knows that, which is why they like the Trump admin right now.  Yeah, and I think that regulation can be a good thing in some instances, for sure. This is probably the instance where regulation would be a good thing. Like the instance.  Okay, I can agree with that, but that doesn't change kind of my argument that I've been making. The number one argument is that people that want to do bad things have access to the open source software and they can very easily do it without a watermark or whatever regulation you plan on making. Unless you're planning on like making the most restrictive Internet possible where you when you log on online, you have to take a I already responded to this. I'm getting a little like there are laws against murder. People still murder. Is is that the social should murder be legal?  But here's the thing, though. This would be like us back in the Stone Age, and you're telling me we need laws against murder because we need to stop bad people from murdering. I'm saying, sure, have laws against murder, but you're still going to have bad people that murder people. I know, but once you have a regulation, then you can begin enforcing it. I have no doubt that without police, there would be more murdering in South Chicago.  So like you could make the same argument about murder of the cats out of the bag. We've got knives or guns are available. But we're saying what we're saying is that like once you start going down that road, nothing's going to be perfect. But you can at least approach a scenario where that Xi Jinping example is much less likely to happen.  But just saying we can't control it and throwing your hands up. If you did a video like that, you're breaking like a dozen laws that would get you in jail for the rest of your life. If you hacked CNN, uploaded a video of Xi Jinping saying he's going to nuke things or whatever. Take out the hacking of CNN thing. The video itself is the thing.  You don't think I'd be breaking any laws if you were to make a mass panic using a fake. Don't take away the thing. What law have you broken if you make a video, a highly realistic video about Vladimir Putin saying, I have nuked Poland. World War Three is now. What law have you broken?  And there are a million other. Well, answer that. It's a non rhetorical question. Well, if I'm being honest, I can only say that I imagine you're breaking a law because I don't know the legalities of it. If I'm being honest, I can't name a law. I can't point to anything. But I imagine you can definitely go after someone who does something like that. And you'd be very effective. And in fact, the whole point that you're saying to do this is that you dissuade people from doing people on the edge. who would who would maybe maybe do it maybe not you would dissuade those people and i would say that i think that we already have rules in place that would already dissuade them i don't know if you would need like a regulation on that no on the contrary that's wrong people on the internet make money by making ai fake ai porn this is a kind of a niche thing no hold on one sec one sec kind of a niche thing but like taylor swift uh did you know an entire court motion about this she said that she was suing the aggregators of ai making ai porn of her now when i first heard that i was like okay that  you know, she's trying to protect her image, but no, that's actually a valid thing. There were millions, not millions, probably a few hundred, uh, you know, Twitter accounts that got millions of views making AI porn of Taylor Swift. Like for every Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, uh, I'm launching missiles to Poland or I'm launching missiles to Fiji and  There are like 10,000 micro examples. For example, the person who's asking me, I forgot who was making the counterpoint. Would you want your daughter if like, and I hate to pull on the heartstrings here, but would you want your daughter having a picture taken of her? And now there's a video of her on Facebook. You know, porn.com, like for every Xi Jinping example, there are like 10,000 examples per person where the AI could be a negative. And it's like to look at that and say, well, we can't regulate it because the tech is already out there is like.  I've been trying to be what we just do nothing ever. I've been trying to be specific. There are certainly cases that you there are no laws that cover something that's wrong that we can all agree is wrong. And there's no laws that say you can't you can't mesh together someone's head with tits. Like there's probably no law that says you can do that. You can't do that. But maybe there should be. OK, fine. Like whatever. But on the grander scale of things, we're not talking about some idiot who just is a rabble rouser who likes to make AI to hurt people's feelings or to defame people or whatever. I'm talking like if we're talking about a larger scale of things where regulation that would truly inhibit like growth that kind of scale regulation i'm saying that there's i don't see how that regulation could truly really help anything to be on i mean smaller things sure but on the larger scale to say something like you know um you know you can't make a you can no longer make ai videos using someone else's face without the written approval like i mean  Is that even something that you could certainly make a regulation for that? And I wouldn't even be opposed to it. Maybe that's a bad example. But it's the idea that you can stop this stuff in the same way you can stop like the sale of a gun by going to the source of the manufacturer or something. isn't how it works is what i'm i guess what i'm trying to say you can't you there's no there's no but those are fundamentally different examples guns and ai one you have to go to a literal physical store have a background check run on you and the other one um I mean, I think you sign up with your email and your first name and your last name, and now you can make claims about a CEO selling a stock. And that will affect the stock market quicker than you can write a bill saying, never denigrate the stock market. Like, yeah, clearly one of those is going to happen faster. And the one that happens faster, we need to regulate more. I don't think that that's...  I don't think that's a crazy position.  I mean, maybe I'm arguing against it more because the sentiment is what I'm arguing against. Because I don't like the idea that someone hears or they read an article about how AI was like secretly trying to ruin a marriage or something. And then they formulate their entire ideology based on this. I mean, it's actually rich coming from a group like this. We know how articles work. We know how journalism works.  We know how easy it is to distort and to lie by omission and to leave out details. For example, this situation of the blackmailing, they could have intentionally set up the model and trying to see how far, how could they set up a model such that you can have a situation like this. We don't know the details of it. I don't even think the journalist knows the details of it. I think that so much of this stuff is just...  You just don't know unless you actually care. Do you have children?  Just make your point. No, I'm asking, do you have children? Let me say something, because we don't have to get personal. Let me say something to defend Ateas. I think it matters. Look, let me defend Ateas, because Ateas is kind of getting a little bit beaten up. I mean, maybe you're getting at something, because I do ultimately disagree with your point here, but I think the larger point that you're getting at actually is a big thing that should be discussed, and is it just inevitable? Yeah.  I mean, and like, can you regulate this to a meaningful degree? And like, that's kind of my whole point that I was alluding to earlier that I wanted to kind of discuss with JF. And I mean, I guess with the chat, I mean, like, I mean, like, should we all just be team pause AI? Because even, I mean, like, even the best case scenario, because I still think a lot of you guys are missing like the larger point that I'm getting at. Like, I'd say go watch AI 2027. I think we should watch it together on this call, actually.  Okay, sure, sure. But finish your point. So the point that I wanted to finish, and I'll be brief, is that even in the best case scenario, we create an AI, it's very, very smart, but it loves us, and it's never going to take over. You're looking at the stifling of human challenging of the intellect and evolution, and it's like, are we really even going to evolve anymore? And if we do, are we really even going to be in charge? That's kind of the JF argument.  You know, like, will AI suddenly kind of steer us? And I mean, so it's like, even the best case scenario, there's these serious problems. And in the worst case scenario, it's just a whole host of scary things. And I think it all goes back in to tie into the political and to tie it actually, Richard, to a point that I think you have made better than anyone. actually like you're the only guy that's made this is like right now the the trump and the republican party won't regulate because like they're bought off and like the trump administration turns out the trump family turns out to be very corrupt like they're selling influence up there like there was actually an interview too with hunter biden of all people like where he goes through he's like listen if i was guilty of all the stuff that he even said i was guilty of it's not a tenth of what they're doing but um Anyway, like, and, and you have these AI companies, which are in the hands of these people that are these anti-human types. Like you've got a guy like Peter Thiel, who's gay. And it's like, almost like being gay, like he's not capable of creation. And it's like, they want to create this new thing, this AI that's like, that Thiel basically even said in that interview that like, he's not even sure it's a bad thing. If like AI secedes to, humanity itself and and then like you you got types because i mean sam altman said on forums in 2017 and 18 like before he was this billionaire ceo that like he does believe that ai will like cause humans to go extinct and whether or not you know people in this chat think oh the ai doomsday scenario that's just all like a bunch of nonsense and  Sam Altman thinks that and he now is developing an AI. So it's like, you have these anti human, like weird autistic types that like don't love life, like they don't love humanity fundamentally. And they are at the helm developing these like things that should be considered like, like, I mean, Elon Musk, for all Elon's flaws, he seems to have a more rational take on this. And Elon says himself that these things are more dangerous than nukes and they're at the helm of creating them. And we have a point, though, is like, come on, can we connect the dots here, though? Like, come on, if if let's just take you have to take people by their actions, not their words, especially when they're businessmen.  And especially when they're businessmen who are public figures. These are people who are selling you something. Elon Musk is clearly going to tell you that, look, we're super cautious about AI. AI could take over the world. We're going to create a superhuman thing.  But what is he really doing? He's, he's trying to sell you something, but he's also trying to quell your anxiety and tell you that it's okay in my hands. Maybe not in, they don't like Sam Altman at X. And maybe he's saying, you know, those guys over there want to destroy the world. If you just trust me with AI, don't worry, it'll be all good here. And then Sam Altman will say things like, you know, it'll take over the world, but doesn't that titillate investors when you say something like that no i get that i think a lot of ai doom is the mirror image of ai boom it's it's basically reinforcing this discussion i think the ai doom is coming from a different angle as i've expressed and i don't need to again source but i think the source is the same it has the same origin And I think that it is coming from clever people who are pushing a, it doesn't, I mean, it really does, it makes it on everyone's mind. It makes it the center of everything. And attention is in the world of the internet and clicks. attention is what makes money you need to grab people's attention and keep it so obviously by putting forward this idea that you know it could take over the world it's going to do all of our jobs it it makes and it keeps the investors coming in  It keeps them investing more. Because if you tell them the truth about AI, which is that it is actually a struggle. Okay, so if I'm making a financial application that's supposed to help someone make a better decision about how to manage money in a company, it's been taking us years to develop. There's many different pitfalls that we've been hitting into. And the context of the AI is hard to keep. We can't keep the AI thinking more than 30 minutes. We have to reset it.  And then we have to ask ourselves, how do we use heuristics to reset it? In other words, how do we build in traditional logic to help the dumb AI? So they're asking themselves all of these questions, but they're not going to tell that to an investor. They're going to tell the investor, oh, you just wait.  We're going to dominate in this space. It's going to be, it'll take everyone's job. The overhead for running a financial company will be $0 because all you have to do is just do a $20 a month or whatever AI model and it'll take care of everything. Yeah, but Ateus, you've already said that it's saving you time and it saved you the cost of hiring one employee. Maybe you're not the owner of your company.  So like, I mean, yeah, like it's clunky and it's clumsy now, but it's gotten way better. I mean, just in the last year, there's been diminishing returns. If I'm being honest, like I'm not, I'm not quite okay. I mean, it's made leaps in years. Sure. But it's, the acceleration is not exponential. It's log, it's logarithmic. It's something that is decaying. It is not, if, if it were something that could reinforce itself, which is the, the propagation propaganda nonsense that,  then we would have been doomed months ago. I mean, if the idea that it can reinforce itself and there's an exponential growth, like, do we not understand what an exponential curve is? It means that if you take one incremental step, the same increment each month, it means that you're getting a multiplier, a nonlinear multiplier on that in growth. In other words, if you had like an X squared growth, then you would get, would go to two to four and then to eight right so it would not be a two then it would be to 16 not eight plus and then it would go to 32 right so it's growing that fast so obviously this is not a reinforcing machine that's able to just grow exponentially out of control take over the world  It's clearly not that. It's something that has been, it's a struggle, and I'm sorry to kind of, maybe I'm getting a little too passionate about this, but it's for anyone who develops this stuff at a very low level, in other words, not just using it in the back end, I'm talking like making it, then you know that it's actually very difficult and it's hard to push it forward. It's a lot of the stuff that we see about Doomsday comes from people who are  because they want money, they want the investment. And a lot of them are hopeful that maybe they'll get over the hurdle. Maybe some of them understand what I'm saying, but they think that maybe in a year they'll make a breakthrough and large language models will have a new module that will help them keep context longer or make it such that you don't have to have an exponential number of data centers in order to manage these things.  And they figure out a clever way to handle that. You know, maybe they're betting on something like this, but that's clearly not the case in front of us. And I'm sorry that people have anxiety over this. And I would just say to people that do. What's your argument? Is your argument that like the cats out of the bag or AI is overrated? The cats out of the bag argument that I made was about the imaging, creating images that can replicate. Right. But isn't that catastrophic? Right. sure but that's not exponential growth i mean that's okay okay i i agree your answer is that they're separate things separate concerns but we made exponential growth on image production i mean just looking at like 2022 era image production where we are now credible change  No, I would disagree. I would actually say that it's decayed too. I mean, to the human eye, the logic behind it is different. The human eye makes it seem, when you go in an extra high def or whatever, from like 720p to 1080, for example, a human sees it as like amazing leap in technology. But the real leap in technology was a long, long time ago and that it's been decaying or diminishing returns ever since. So it's not, it's to someone who understands the stuff on the backend knows that it's very impressive to look at, but it's not that much better on a logical scale to something that existed a year ago. Okay, I get it. So your argument is that AI is overrated. It's going to be a helpful tool for software engineers going forward. No, maybe, and I'm making nuance of it when I probably shouldn't be, but I don't think that it's overrated. I think the anxiety is overrated. And I think that  But as a tool, it's absolutely going to change things. And I think that mostly a good way, a lot of bad, like I've already said, I don't like the idea that a lot of companies are marketing what are, in essence, cheating tools to college students and telling them that they don't have to read chapters in their textbook. They can just use the AI machine that gives them a very short summary or whatever. Things like that I don't think are good. And I think that if there needs to be a regulation, maybe it should be somewhere like that, because I think that human development is probably the most important thing to preserve, more than anything else. I think that's the most important thing to preserve is taking that out of the hands of people who are adolescents. But on the other side of things in adulthood and professionalism, I think you're going to see a lot of good growth. And I think it's going to be an overall good thing. And certainly there can be regulations to help out. But what I'm trying to do, I guess, probably if it were to kind of back up and do like the 30,000 foot view of things, I'm trying to just make it such that people are not misinformed. Because I think a lot of people live their lives in anxiety thinking that the world will literally end. And that's not hyperbole. I think that there are people even in this call.  who in the bottom of their heart believe the world will end from AI in the next five years. And if it doesn't end in fire and brimstone, they think it'll end by hacking our minds and turning us into zombies or whatever. These are concerns that I'm trying to dispel and say that that's not how it's working. That's not the growth rate we're looking at. And the models have...  have clear limits on how they can work. If they're going to adapt, they need to be doing it on a different level. You can't just make a larger language model that is going to like like, solve problems, like, figure out the fundamental forces and how they relate to each other or something. Like, these are just, they're just absurd and they're not, they don't get to the essence of, and by the way, sorry to kind of ramble and I've said it before, you can cut me off, it doesn't bother me, but you've said it before, Richard, and I think it's probably the most insightful thing that's been said on AI, and I'm not glazing, I mean this, is that you said that AI is an averager. It's the great averager. It aggregates and it figures out things that kind of brings things to the mean. It's very good at that and very fast at that. And I think that is...  its fundamental form as it sits right now. I don't think that it's something that is capable of reinforcing itself in a way that, and there are models called reinforcement learning and that's a different story, but there's these models, these language models don't work in that way. So I just, I think that your instincts on it, whenever we're thinking about things kind of in a logical progression, we're able to be rational And then there are times where we look at a video and it kind of hits our reptile brain and then it scares us. And then we, and then we all of a sudden kind of lose rationality and then everything becomes like the end of the world. I just, I would just try to caution people against, you know, I try to have more control over that reptile brain. That's telling you there's an enemy around the corner. Who's going to steal your family and kill you. You know, it's, it's kind of like a caveman. mindset that i think is kind of mostly no that's that's that's fair enough um just out of curiosity what what is going on here with the scratch pad who's doing this i don't know i'm wondering about that too okay are you doing are you just doodling or  Okay, I'm just going to stop you. There. It's gone. Okay. Let's just watch a little bit of this video. And do you really want me to talk about Hassan? Hassan's terrible. Yes, please do. Okay. Yes. Richard, go for it, man. I hate that guy.  Fuck Hassan. I kind of want to watch this AI video, but okay. Let's just, just so we are not misrepresenting anyone. Let's see the offending thing here. Why is it this? Here we go. i hate this country so much you can be on a mountain in the middle of norway and get better internet than los angeles california isn't it funny how that's why he hates america like i hate this country so much norway better internet i don't watch any of hassan and like my introduction to hassan was him torturing his dog apparently and i had to see yes i had the same reaction you did like this is what this guy talks about like america is this evil empire like what i didn't realize that this is how the clip opened yeah yeah he doesn't he can't download his porno slop fast enough like what does the world come to yeah this is the leading light of the left  Also, really quickly, notice he, I mean, because he's Turkish. Yes. But it's just, I mean, this is kind of a grug point, but, you know, he said Norway. I don't know. I mean, like, you know, he didn't say Turkey. I love Turkey so much more. The internet in Turkey is the best. i heard it's romania actually it has some of the best internet but it also has like a low percent of the population by european standards yeah with toy with like indoor plumbing so it's kind of an archaeo futurist state interesting wow better broadband than plumbing wow that is remarkable and this is just like a moment of anger this is a moment of fucking anger for like something that is just so routine so silly such a first world problem but it is emblematic of all of America's much more consequential violence violence it's violent so he was like reflected for like five seconds he was like this is a first world problem I'd admit but it's actually emblematic of Gaza  Okay. Okay. It's the same reason as to why America, Kaya, please just fucking go. Stop. Okay. That's where he does it. yeah rewind that real quick okay so again we don't know what's going on here we just have one camera view but he's getting annoyed by the slow internet and then kaya the dog gets up from its i guess it's like a cot situation we have going on here just go stop okay i would you stop i think it's also passive aggressive and feminine the way that he even like speaks to like a creature that he has dominion over so he has a creature there and he's like that that he controls like make no bones about it like he determines when the dog eats and drinks water  And his breakout was like, stop. He has to use an external control device to control a thing. That's a good point. He has no control over his life.  And he wanted to immediately be like, oh, wait, stop. This is your fault. Exactly. I think it was more in reaction to that rather than this is the way he treats the creature normally.  The other thing is that he goes to direct punishment. And, you know, look, the shock collar is not going to kill a dog. But could you imagine having, like, a little automatic, like, pricker or something on your hand? Like, whenever you... said something out of line or were late to work or whatever, that you'd get just this little like pinch or like a little pen go tick tick. After a while, that would, you wouldn't get used to it. After a while, you would be, you would feel totally out of control. Like some godlike figure is torturing you and for no reason. I mean, it's just horrible. Yeah.  And he goes to that as opposed to expressing his authority over the dog. Like if you want to discipline a dog, which you obviously have to do many occasions a day, it's like Zeus, come here, sit.  you're in charge. You're not, you're not like torturing the animal. You're reminding him that you are the daddy. Well, and that's why there's something, and you know, I haven't tweeted about this or anything, but there is something deeply feminine about Hassan's response to the dog. Because if you were like, and this isn't like boastfulness or anything, but like,  If you genuinely had dominion over the dog, you would say, sit down, be quiet. Okay, now you have to be quiet. Resorting to that kind of violence is... I think there's something feminine there. It reminds me of how African-American black moms, their initial thing is beat their kid with a belt. We're going to whoop that boy. We're going to whip that boy. It's like...  wouldn't it actually be more masculine? And I guess I'm asking a lot, like, would you really reason with a dog? Fair point. I'm just saying, like, my initial instinct is not to, like...  but an electric collar around the animal that I've. It's horrible. Look, electric collars are sold. You use an electric collar to make sure that the dog like stays within a zone or something like if you want to keep a dog from not running off, you can sort of like set a boundary and it's a very clear boundary that it knows. So dogs can reason. all animals you reason is not some we purchase of the human like we have a monopoly on reason all animals use rationality they will find the shortest distance between two points also dogs will negotiate and uh they you know like they'll give you the sad eyes at the very least when they want you to give them food  So like, I mean, a dog is not going to like read Shakespeare, but a dog understands reason. And I would even imagine that this dog doesn't even understand that Hassan's torturing it and is just has some weird view that like the world's irrational and occasionally like demons strike you with lightning bolts or something. It's just totally evil what he's doing.  totally evil and the other thing about it is that it's a dog like Yeah, there are like serious hunters or something who really discipline dogs and get them to get, they're going to do the specific purpose. They're going to go pick up the bird, but not hurt the bird, harm, you know, harm the product, bring it to the master. They understand that they are working and that you're in charge. Yeah, absolutely. This is a house pet.  I mean, come on. A dog is not going to sit there for your six-hour stream. And you shouldn't want it to. A dog should just walk around and go drink water and then go take a nap and then go play with his ball. This is just so...  It's the banality of evil. It's like a petty form of evil, but it is absolutely evil. And I'll let you go here, Jordan, but real quick. Remember, RFH, we talked about this. There's that evil... I think she's a Mormon... YouTube mother or something who was sadistically torturing her children and then at some point they escaped. She's thankfully in prison right now.  The one on the Netflix series, yeah. They were Mormon, but then she kind of joined this weird cult that was, I guess, Mormon adjacent, and it was all for women, and they would kind of just chide the men. Yeah. Yeah, but she was torturing her children, starving them, hurting them in irrational ways, which makes, turns you into like a psychopath, basically. If the world, like imagine just being a child  And your parents are like drug users and they're like passed out while you're awake. And you've got to go like find food and handle things on your own. You just like generate like a psychopath basically or sociopath, I guess, in this case. By making them think that the world is cruel and irrational. It's like the worst possible thing to do.  And it's not on that level. It's not on that level. This is like a low level, like evil that Hassan is engaging with. And it is a microcosm of how he views the world at large, the way he treats this animal. And thirdly, he clearly is not an animal lover and has no relationship with this dog, nor does he have any sort of reasonable expectation of dog behavior. So what he is, is this Turkish pirate.  Basically, who just get stuff. It's like I got a Rolex. I got a Maserati car, whatever expensive automobile he has. You know, I got this cool fungo pop that you can see in the background. I got an autographed basketball or whatever the fuck this moron has. and that's how he thinks this dog is just like that he wants the dog to sit there so he can show off the fact that he spent like five or ten grand on like some expensive breed of dog the dog is not his friend which a dog is dog you're the master of course that your dog is your friend  And this dog is not his friend. This dog is the equivalent of wearing a Rolex or something. It's just for him, at least. It's just some thing that you want to put on camera to show off. It's a prop. Yeah, it's a prop. Yeah. Resumably to appeal to the primarily young women that watch him. Like, it's even kind of... predatory in that way as well um and the the best faith interpretation of this is that he didn't shock the dog but he's screaming at it for simply getting up off its cot because he needs it right there perfectly in the shot of his six hour stream and he can't allow the animal to move which is insane to begin with that's the most generous thing yeah  And there's more going on. I'll let you speak in a moment here, Jordan, but I'll just sum it up real quick. There's more going on. So, of course, he's an idiot. And so he's like, why are you so mad at me? Look, it's a vibration collar. And he, like, taped over the electrical shocks with duct tape or electrician's tape. And then also he showed it on camera so that...  people could go look at this product in Amazon and lo and behold, you can shock dogs with it. So he didn't even bother like going out and buying a vibration collar. I know, but also a vibration collar doesn't, work outside of a shock collar what you will do like if you're training a hunting dog is you'll shock them and with the vibration so it's like pavlovian basically and then you'll just use the vibration so they'll they'll kind of remember the vibration and then you stop using the vibration collar it's it's a training mechanism you don't keep an animal on a fucking shock collar 24 7 so you can buzz it anytime you want out of  Like, for good reason or just for sadism, which is what Hassan would do. I mean, I hate this motherfucker with a murderous passion. I want to put a shock collar on Hassan and... i'll just be honest here his entire people and sadistically randomly shock them until they go insane because they don't get it they don't get what it means to be a civilized person they don't understand even in his case what it means to be a marxist because Marx, unlike this pirate, actually believes in world transformation in a way that I don't like, but I'll at least hand it to Marx. He was an idealist. Hasan just wants to take your shit, and he can get it. He is...  The most despicable human being I believe I've ever encountered. The just absence of any sort of moral capacity is just breathtaking, right? And again, like I know this ironically passive-aggressive of me, the only way to deal with someone like Hassan Piker is with a shock collar. Because he has no ability to understand reason, idealism, morality, and civilization. He is either going to be your master, he is going to be standing over you, shocking you,  Or you make him your slave. Have I gotten my point across? Yes. I think you did, Richard. Richard, I love it. I'll be honest, like when you wanted to talk about Hassan, I was kind of thinking it'd be a boring topic because I was like, okay, like what's the talk about? I hate this guy. He shocked his dog. But that was righteous. I wish we'd hit that earlier. There were two things I kind of wanted to bring up to you, Richard. As far as the Hassan thing goes. So parenting, first of all,  This level of... I mean, it's basically psychopathy. When you look at Richard Hanania, his older brother is already dead, but I think he died in jail. Richard Hanania's older brother... He died of an overdose. Okay, but he still threw two dogs. Yes. Oh, yes. Toy poodles. Yeah, threw toy poodles... Puppies, I believe. ...off a building or something, yeah. That he bought from his own money. It was...  So I guess the thing is basically inherited mental illness. That's what I see here. Yeah, I just kind of wanted to get your take on that. Did Richard Hanania defend Hassan? I'm just curious. Or did he deflect or something? I don't know if he tweeted about Hassan. he really knowing his background i'm even defending richard here a little bit knowing his background he should just not yeah i mean he didn't defend his brother he said he was glad his brother died right so  That was pretty... I'm going to give a little charity to Richard Hanani, actually. Yeah, I don't think he's tweeted about it. I can't find anything. Well, I think in terms of his brother, I mean, it's very... It's sort of crazy to wish death upon your brother, but at the same time, I also sort of can sympathize with being put through hell by a... psychotic family member I well I can't I can sympathize I can't empathize no one in my family is psychotic but I could imagine what that would be like and yeah I didn't I wasn't offended that he said that I kind of will give him some leeway actually on that one but I mean again wishing to say I'm glad my sibling is dizzy it's a bit much but I'll actually give Richard a little bit of leeway  I don't think in the case of Hassan, I don't think it's mental illness. I mean, no, it's not mental illness. No, he's like that. But yeah, I mean, like unless you consider being a Turk mentally ill, which I mean, you know, like we can have that discussion. We should put that in the DSM. Turk. Turk. Richard, I mean, just once again, like that was so righteous what you said, but you touched on a good point that is worth just sort of dilating on. And I see this in Miami probably more than anyone. And it's this tendency of certain people.  And look, just to be honest, it's a lot of people from that region of the world. There's something about your ancestry being in the middle of the trade routes between Europe and China and Africa. And it just creates this type of... um like you see it in like um jews and i mean like turks where it's like these people that they they will get like the trappings of like success and high civilization like they'll get jewelry like nice cars like they're very often fake down here in miami like even fake um like i know of a guy that had a fake lamborghini that had like a bmw engine in it  And I mean, that kind of thing happens all the time down here. And but like it's again, it's like the trappings of high civilization and like being successful. And like, look, fair enough. I mean, like it's not it doesn't you don't have to be a Turk to want to fake it till you make it. I mean, but you do see that very commonly.  in people, you know, from that region of the world. At least I have. And I see it down here in Miami every day. Yeah, they just don't get it. And it's kind of frustrating because when you are successful and it's like you want nice things because you are kind of successful and want to tastefully kind of indulge a little bit, it's like, well, shit. I mean, when you think of a guy driving a Lamborghini, I mean, what do you think of? Like you think of a guy like Hassan or you think of like some – broccoli hair zoomer kid who's selling you a course on instagram who's like gonna scam you and um anyway so yeah good points yeah um i i don't know if there's much more that we need to say on this or or or or something we didn't touch on but um Yeah, I just don't think you should assume that everyone else that and that includes psychopaths and so on who are among us, but but also just other people think like you and have your empathetic capacity. And  in the case of Hassan, like his worldview and his sadism are just reinforcing one another. He's not a Marxist. He is a Turkish pirate. He wants to take shit from other people. which maybe on some level is Marxist, but that's not at all what, and I'm praising Marx here, defending him at the very least. That's not at all what the left should be about.  Just like taking trinkets from the rich and enjoying them. That's just like peasant revolt type shit. That's just like anarchy or mayhem. That's not leftism. But that's all he is. That's his ideology. I don't think he can conceive of a world where that wouldn't be what it means to be on the left. and and that goes for everything i i think adam something who's this leftist actually i think he's like a former rightist become a leftist who did videos and and things like that he said this exact thing in much more polite manner over the ukraine crisis where hassan was supporting russia as usual and of course when he was asked this by that like idiot Jew, Adam Freeland, who has somehow overturned the findings of Richard Lynn and others on Jewish intelligence, just as one individual. But he was on there, and it's like... He doesn't have a capacity to think what this war might mean or the implications of an invasion to take territory or implications of a Russian invasion to take territory.  The only way he thinks about these things is like, oh, U.S. support Ukraine. I hate America because bad Internet. Fuck Ukraine. That's like there is really genuinely nothing else to it. And so Adam something just nailed him up against the wall where he was like, you're not a leftist. You're just a kind of reactionary anti-American. Right.  And there is a difference. There's this joke of conservatives and the liberal media. If the liberal media told them that there's no nutrition in eating dog shit, then conservatives would start eating dog shit for breakfast.  Because they're so reactionary. That's what Hassan is. Like they did that thing of like, there was the New York Times where they're praising this freak and they're like, you know, oh, he's a leftist mind in a MAGA body or whatever. No, he's a third world mind in a third world body. If anything, he's a MAGA mind in a third world body. There's no there there.  That's what you're dealing with. When you meet Hassan, you're dealing with the five-foot-two greaseball in Sicily who comes up and tries to help you with your luggage so he can steal it. There are just humans like this. There's no ability to reason with them. There's no ability to move them past these things.  There are just lumpen races of criminals on this planet. I just hate him. I don't even know what women watch him. He looks like a fucking monkey. What is attractive about Hassan?  No one who is even mildly educated thinks Hassan is a serious Marxist or whatever. So who watches this garbage? Other third world people like himself? Apparently, according to RFH, it's women that you are to blame. Okay.  I would also say, as far as Hassan's audience, I would say that it's, well, RFH is right. It's a lot of young women who think he's hot. You could say that about Candace. But I think with Hassan, there are, and these are people I've met in my life also, people with wealthy families who kind of have a guilt complex. They feel bad that they're doing well in life.  They may have gone to SMU for literally $0. And they do kind of have a chip on their shoulder. And they feel bad that their family got them that position at SMU or TCU, wherever, because of their family's name. like you know that i i would say that that represents um kind of a lot of the guys that listen to um whether it's a song destiny a lot of those kind of people but but also just to go further here like i am asking this in a non-rhetorical fashion have the turks contributed anything to civilization  Now, that's very rude to even ask that question now, isn't it? I would not ask that question about African Americans or Africans who have clearly contributed things to civilization. And I'm not just, you know, yeah, there's... michael jordan or michael jackson but i'm not even i'm not even saying that that is a contribution actually to be an amazing or jordan b man to be fair jordan b right to be fair maybe right um that the first off um being a great athlete or a great blues guitarist or a great dancer or that is a contribution in my book i think culture is more important than economics But like, what can you possibly say about Turks outside of war pirating and warmongering people? I've been to Istanbul. They've had that city for 500 years. It is a shithole.  It is horrible. It's this like combination of everything bad. It's like the laziness of Southern Italy plus Islam in this just mess. There's nothing you can say about it. That used to be a Roman city. It is now a Turkish shitty and it is a shithole.  Name, someone, name, a Turk who is not a criminal or general shitty person or just layabout. Like, where is it? Like, they, as a people, they are just uniquely, like, they have a genius for contributing nothing positive to the world.  And I wouldn't say that about peoples and races that have far lower IQs than they do. They are truly incredible. Yeah. I think even the Muslim world, all their contributions come out of Iran or Persia or whatever. Yeah, I can't.  I can't think of anything that came out of Turkey other than just a warring, greedy empire. I can think of one NBA player named Mehmet Oker who played for the Utah Jazz up until 2018. That's the only productive Turk I can think of. There's also Hidu Turkoglu. Was he a Turk? Really?  Yeah, he was Turk. I didn't know that. Okay, I knew about Mehmet Oker. Didn't know about Hito. There's Dr. Oz. Yeah, someone mentioned that in the chat. I didn't even know he was Turkish actually. Yeah. There you go. And what is Dr. Oz? He might have been a decent physician, just to be totally fair here, but what do we really remember Dr. Oz for? I think it's the scams. Yeah.  You know? I mean, just... Ugh. Isn't there also, like, a Muslim commandment against dogs? Like, you can use them as tools, but you can't love them. Dogs in Islam are considered unclean. You see the videos of, like, people walking dogs up next to Muslim immigrants, and they freak out, and... Hassan is not Muslim, but he's constantly referred to himself as culturally Muslim to kind of give himself an ethnic shield. Yeah. It's just crazy because, you know, people on this call can understand this, but a lot of people can't that like even a seemingly secular educated person. when they grew up in a totally different culture that has just been saturated in islam that has that thinks of something like a dog like this versus like a european who kind of like co-evolved with dogs and they've always been our natural companion  It's just leads to totally different civilizations and personality types. And I would support Donald Trump. You know, we have this whole debate about birthright citizenship. He could gain my support by actually following through and deporting Hassan back to Turkey. Yes. Or connecting with Antifa, which wouldn't be terribly hard. One of his listeners, who is this weird nerd-looking person, was arrested before he could do a terror attack. It's just sort of amazing, actually. I just... I don't know. I just find his... I just find him... Breathtaking. Breathtaking.  actually like how awful he is. What do you make Richard? Just picking up with that last comment as a potential sort of small pivot of guys like Hassan and then like the rest of like the Russo sphere of,  like the Russo right and even like the Russo left. So I guess guys, and I agree with your description. What do you mean like the Russoian, like the Russo, or are you talking about Thomas Russo?  Sorry, sorry. Is it like Russian? So like the Russian... Oh, the Russ... Oh, yeah. Okay, Russo. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, so I guess guys like Hassan and his brother and like Anna Kasparian on the left. But I mean, also Max Blumenthal and Greenwald and then of course Tucker and then Candace even. They've been the hardest on Israel like the last month and really since Kirk's assassination too.  What do you make of that? I think they're genuine. I think Blumenthal and other people are genuinely anti-Zionist. I think that Tucker is playing some weird game where he's against Netanyahu. He's trying to capture the audience. Yeah, it's audience capture. but i mean do you want me to just say i mean i'll just say it um the you know what is the line of like at a mob funeral you should always go look for who's crying the loudest because he's the one who killed him  I don't know what to say. The thought has crossed my mind. I don't have any evidence for this, but the thought has crossed my mind that this was a kind of Russian chaos strategy to push someone over the edge to kill Charlie Kirk. And the fact that they... fingered Israel right off the bat just sort of changes the subject because I was even just when I was going to bed last night there was like a video of like Chris Cuomo or something and he was asking do you think that Tyler Robinson killed Charlie Kirk or was it Israel like he was sincerely asking so they've already got this like little dialectic going and I don't know I mean that that's what comes to my mind now I would just assert again that I don't have any evidence for this so I'm not I'm not going to come out full-throated and say I know this is how what happened I'm just going to say that you might want to if if there is some sort of like foreign asset working to push people over the edge i i would not be surprised if it were russia um but you can make a lot of other cui bono arguments like i last tuesday we were talking about how this idea of the golem sort of fits he charlie fits the bill of the golem run amok that you have to deactivate so that also works but  Again, we're dealing with theory here, and we're not dealing with hard facts and evidence. And that's important to point out. I would say, too, the comment you said that this Adam character said about Hassan, reactionary anti-Americanism, that encapsulates the Russian strategy perfectly, media strategy, wouldn't you say? Exactly. exactly because we don't know what to think and it's just it just sort of drives you mad i don't think there's anything else to it i don't think charlie was about to turn on russia or something because i i find the whole like thing with charlie when you go down the israeli line I become suspicious of it because it's almost too rational in the sense that it's like A, B, C. It's like Charlie was good for Jews, Charlie turned on Jews, Charlie died. I think an assassination is much bigger than that because Charlie, it wasn't just that Charlie died or they got rid of him. It's that Charlie became a myth and not a man after being killed on camera three weeks ago, you know, like his profile has expanded. He's become Jesus. Like he's become more powerful in death than he ever was in life. So it's, If you understand what I'm saying, like, if this was some like Israeli theater, I think they would have recognized this. now the russian chaos strategy would be like let's get people off the fence let's knock them off the fence let's there's some people who are crazy on a discord server they're mentally ill and let's just push them to go kinetic and it will go in this way in that they'll shoot a school they'll shoot charlie kirk they'll uh blow up a walmart or whatever you know they just want to push them in some direction to create societal chaos erica killed him out of love he wanted to give him a beautiful legacy make him more powerful oh  RFH supports the murder of Kurt Cobain by Courtney Love. No, Erica's reaction was disgusting. But there is a good point that that's what Charlie would have wanted. Like a continuation. Pyrotechnics. Actually, yeah. He wasn't evangelical. No, no, no. He was about to become a based...  Brad Calf, Latin mass attending. He was about to spit on BB. I promise. Raphael? Yes, something maybe we didn't catch from the video was that Hassan's getting all worked up about the Wi-Fi. He's shouting, he's like, and then the dog moves.  And then the dog comes towards him. What if the dog saw he was upset, came over to see, oh, what's going on? This is my guy. Maybe the dog does have that relationship with him. And then Hasan's like, ah, you fucking mutt. And then he electrocutes him. The dog is more empathetic than Hasan, is what you were saying. And gets punished for it. Yes. Dogs have more empathy than Turks. yes I think that's cool I I agree with Rafael I think because he was complaining what it what is his internet not load fast enough and he's like I hate America God loves America a dog sort of can't help but love its owner even if its owner is a horrible person because it's just sort of wired that way and  That's why a bad dog owner, there's just something evil about it. It's like why crimes against children are sort of worse, you know, than crimes against adults. You know, it's like we feel it seems to be worse to abuse a child than to beat up an adult. Because you're sort of like taking... Like an adult should be...  not so innocent. An adult should be aware of the ways of the world. But with a child, they should be trusting and seeking to learn from authority and so on. And you're taking that and destroying it and ruining it. You're using the good instincts of a child against the child. There's something just more wicked about that. Yeah, it reminds me of how people talk about the black community.  And they say that the biggest problem is that both parents are not in the home. But you look at videos where the mom is clearly like, doesn't have the cognitive ability to have both in the home. So she's like stealing from a store and she has kids in her front seat. It's a whole thing. But conservatives will look at that and be like... if only the dad was there too it's like no the dad is in like prison right now like it's actually the dad is robbing the liquor store yeah like the dad is like hey sell me what you stole today yeah like it's it's even worse than that and it's like what stephen crowder was doing today um he's making the north texas uh university run so he's going from smu to tcu unt doing the whole um change my mind thing and he did one two days ago he's down in denton yeah no he's he's doing the whole thing yeah no that's real by the way and uh he terrible place well he did a it's it was supposed to be an austin knockoff could you imagine  Could you imagine? I mean, it's not that bad, but it's just sort of like it's very beige. I've been to Denton. I don't know. Maybe things have changed in the last 20 years, but go on. Yeah, no. All I was going to say was that Crowder released a video today.  where he did a debate with, I think, you know, five or six black guys in a black barbershop. And it was supposed to be a play, like, on Matt Walsh's What is a Woman. And he's just, like, going to, like, black barbershops telling them about black crime. Oh, my God. And they're, like, a second away from, like, punching him. He's like, no, no, no. But you didn't know that Triple, like...  I'm like, dude, why are we doing this? Like, what is the point? He did 1350 in a black barbershop in Denton, Texas. That is like the worst idea on so many levels. Not to mention personal safety. Yeah, I'll message it to you. It's pretty funny, though. Anyway.  I do need to dip, though, but hey, good talk to you, Richard. All right. Regular guy? Yeah, so in regards to Hassan and how he's really a kind of opposite character to Marx in terms of personal life. I mean, Hassan is just interested in collecting things, and granted, to be fair, the 19th century, there wasn't much of an opportunity for consumerism. but i actually so i actually read stores came about in that period but go on well yes but in terms of mark's personal life i actually read or listened to a bit of uh videos by people critiquing him as a bad person and it actually made me kind of admire him a bit more in terms of i found it funny he didn't bathe and he had boils but my Regardless, even though Marx essentially created his own problems, he was kind of an admirable character. He was such a bad person that it makes him kind of admirable in that he was a character who faced adversity. he sacrificed everything to write his books he lived in poverty um he got arrested for weapons charges and was a drunk layabout but he wasn't really interested in material things if he was interested in material things he would have gotten a proper profession and you leverage his middle class background but he was the opposite of hassan piker where hassan it's all about the  oh, I can just consume drip. And Marx is a true crusader. He almost lived up a life like Jesus Christ, but in the 19th century. Yeah, I agree.  I agree. Whereas Hassan Piker is clearly being rewarded for this behavior in our slop media sphere, such as it is. Reward for being a Turk. Yeah. You know, it almost makes you want to support Israel. Because it's like, if we're going to have a strategic partner in the Middle East that might  really project power there for us in this newly balkanized and toppled region? It's like, do we want it to be Turkish people? Yeah, no, I get that.  I think there has to be... You have to fill the vacuum of Israel. The idea that Israel is our aircraft carrier, it's not right, but it's not wrong. It does create situations in which we have worse relations with Arab powers. But I do agree that were Israel to poof and banish, you would have to fill that void with something. And the idea that we would then like get on great with all these wonderful Muslims or something. I mean, give me a break. There is actually a book written called What If Israel Lost Six Day War? It's an obvious fluff piece of propaganda. And it's really maybe it's more accurate in a way than a lot of alternate history novels.  it just covers sort of the immediate aftermath. Basically the country is divided. The Palestinians don't get their own country. Like it doesn't become Palestine, but it's, you know, split up between Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and the neighboring like sovereign states. And they actually import a bunch of, uh,  SS officers to run concentration camps for Jews. So, um, cause you know, it's set in the sixties and there are still plenty of them. I didn't read it. I just read the Wikipedia summary. So it's kind of like basic, It's kind of like it's just the aftermath of Israel is just replaced with like a mishmash of bickering Arab states in a way. Now, it's obviously a fluff piece of Israeli propaganda, but it's probably true that if that were to happen, I mean, would – granted, it's different in the 60s now, but that's probably what would be the case. You'd have, I guess, another Jordan. Yeah.  Well, gents, why don't we do this? We have gone for four hours and the conversation has moved off the AI thing. I'm going to watch this AI 2037, is that what it is? Or 2027? AI 2027, it's sooner than I thought. And I'll see if this is worth watching in the future. But since we have done, yeah, we've done four hours, that's good.  I think this is a good place to take a break. All right. Yeah, we can talk about Nick and Dave Smith a little bit later. That was something I also had on my personal scratch pad, but we'll just save that. All right, guys. I will talk to you soon. Thanks for being here. Ciao.

I have my own disagreements here and there. That's what he's saying. I think there's a lot of ways that they're in parallel, but I just, I really didn't want to push back too much. I kind of wanted to let him cook. I'm glad we did that. It is fascinating that he has a kind of dual perspective, a very contrasting perspective of China with their own social media and then America's, too. It's very it's it's interesting. Definitely. Do you guys want to go into the Charlie Kirk thing for the last hour or so? We could also talk. we could also talk about some other things the jimmy kimmel thing i think is worth talking about but almost on a meta level i i gave you a hint of my thinking about this in my interview but uh i kind of feel like talking about conspiracies actually so uh maybe we should do that yeah regular guy So with the controversy over designate Antifa as a terrorist group, which it's not a group, you'd have to like go after individual cells. And that's and you can't really do an illegal organization, especially when it's a it's not there is no designation for a terrorist group that is homegrown. now if al-qaeda is in the united states but it is a foreign terrorist group due to you know the constitution the first amendment citizenship etc now there is a designation that is basically called domestic extremist and uh so you are treating people as a category in that way  And so I think Antifa could be treated in that way. Well, since you forced the conversation in this direction, before we talk about Charlie Kirk, we'll just hit the Antifa thing. I I think there's a lot going on here. First off, the most obvious is that the Trump administration is going for it. They are absolutely capitalizing on Charlie Kirk's death. And I don't know exactly what this is going to mean, but these liberal apologists who are saying things like, well, isn't everyone anti-fascist? And that's what they want. They want to arrest everyone or whatever. This is just nonsense. I mean, this is like the definition of pornography. You know it when you see it. Maybe there are some gray lines, but everyone knows what you are talking about when you say Antifa or anti-fascist. It is people wearing masks, heavily drug-addled, getting into fights with the alt-right or the Proud Boys or the Patriot Front or whatever, and being nasty and getting nastiness in return. uh to be fair being a vanguard that's more left than the left or it circles back to being right wing in some crazy way uh where it is uh you can find some tankies among them who love the soviet union i remember like an mbi conference in 2013 or something where antifa were protesting us and they were outside saying you know stalin was right he know he knew what to do with people like you kill the germans so you have some tanky elements i think you have some genuine anarchist elements it's mostly anarchists mostly these are just you know viewed as like oh what are you 14  Well, okay, but they were there. But you know what you're talking about when you say Antifa. And, you know, I've done a couple of tweets on this, and I'll just sort of reproduce what I was saying in those tweets. But... So first off, I think it's best not to just criticize Antifa for being smelly or for being drug addled or for throwing milkshakes or urine, I remember in one case in 2016, or just being contemptible leftist assholes. You can obviously make that critique, but that's easy.  I think it's more interesting to critique them on their own terms. And that's what I was saying last night, is that not only are they terrible people, but they're terrible communists. And I don't remember Antifa criticizing the deep state. And here I don't mean some boogeyman entity. I mean the military industrial complex, et cetera. I can remember a 2017... protest that I was involved in with the alt-right where we were actually telling Trump, we were in front of the White House telling Trump not to invade Syria. And we were getting protested by Antifa. And Mike Enoch said, so you're protesting our protest of Donald Trump and his possible war. So that means you support bombing Syria and you support Donald Trump apparently now, you know, that's maybe a little autistic, but I, I think the, the, but it was good. The, the point that he was getting at is that they seem to go after people without any real power. They're going after ideas. They're policing speech. They are attacking Richard Spencer, right? They are getting into brawls with Proud Boy thugs in Portland, Oregon, of all places, about as far from power, geographically at least, that you can get. And that's what they're into. They are terrified of a guy who's dead broke and just got off a divorce and has been... battling alcoholism for 10 years they're terrified of that man saying the n-word and yet they seem to have no conception or critique of actual power and so they're sort of weirdly not even marxist um and yeah as i joked we don't want to send them to seacott of course because they might actually enjoy it you know they would be like that guy in utah saying like shoot me shoot me i did it shoot me punish me punish me well one of the senators in oklahoma said he criticized it and basically said oh yeah well what about white nationalism and remember when um in france they ban generation identity in as well as a bunch of muslim groups do you think that like we'll see a bunch of attempts to ban like wn orgs tacked on to it just for trump to say like oh i'm kind of fair too and he'll like try to ban i don't know uh blood tribe or whatnot um you know that is certainly possible and  I just wonder if they're not going to even bother doing that at this point. You know, are they going to really ban Patriot Front? I mean, Patriot Front is a bunch of Nazis, to be honest. But, you know, they're sort of conservative people.  Nazis, they they were out there speaking on behalf of Charlie Kirk. I think previously I would have agreed with you that in an even handed way, they would have like gone after the right as well. But I actually wonder if they're going to even do that. And notice this, too, with the Charlie Kirk situation where. You know, Ben Shapiro was defending the Groypers in a way when he was saying, no, I don't think this is a Groyper killer. Now, he wasn't endorsing Nick Fuentes, but he was running cover for the Groypers. Just saying. So I think we're just in a new place, and I think they're just going to go after the left, to be honest.  I don't know. I might be wrong. Maybe they can scapegoat some group on the right just to present themselves. I just don't present themselves as fair, but I just don't think they give a shit anymore. John Kim, you want to jump in? Yeah. I think you mentioned it, but sort of how Antifa... Just the mediocrity of it when you look at, you know, it's easy to critique the boomers, but the boomers at least had like the weather underground where they took on, you know, powerful structure. So.  Yeah, the boomers at least have an ideology. You know, they want a president with balls who will bomb Iran. And that's at least something as opposed to attempting to, in my case, just simply police speech or in the case of the Proud Boys, just get into fights. Now, I think the Proud Boys was the mirror image of Antifa in the sense that the Proud Boys just wanted to get into fights. I mean, what do the Proud Boys stand for exactly? The West, I guess. cereal brands, but yeah, they are weirdly vacuous and they're just a sort of like personality type that wants to join Antifa. But this is also something that I wrote about on Twitter and I genuinely don't have an answer to, and that is what happened to Antifa, because this is all coming in 2025. This would have been very interesting if done in 2017. Imagine designating them as a domestic extremist group in 2017 and Charlottesville being actually peaceful. Fascinating. So  I don't history would have been different perhaps, but so I, it is a sort of lost cause. I don't know the last time I've seen Antifa in action. And I would say it was 2020. I remember in 2019, they were still winning fights to give them some credit. They were winning fights in Portland, Oregon against the proud boys. So I,  I don't know what happened to them, and I offered a number of answers to this. And also, just before I go into those, also, J6. So the conspiracy theory, at least initially, was that it was Antifa that did J6. Now, I've seen a few videos that might be mildly convincing on that account, but overall, that's just obviously complete bullshit. QAnon was much more integral to J6, but...  the question arises of, like, where were they at J6? So you want to go to Charlottesville where the alt-right were marching on behalf of a statue. Pure symbolism. And it's very hard. Okay, fine. I guess that's your right on some level. You want to get in fights with Proud Boys. You want to go yell and scream at conservatives or whatever. You add a situation where, at least ostensibly, That was a actual fascist coup where Donald Trump was trying to remain in office, maybe never leave office. And he was implementing populist on his behalf and threatening democratically elected representatives. And you didn't show up. Like, what what are you waiting for? Like, what what or does Trump have to do to get your attention?  I don't even know what to say. I have asked this question to people and they're like, oh, well, it was COVID. You know, they were worried. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Even if there were a measles outbreak, you've got to get out there. What are you, a bunch of pussies or something? I mean, I don't even know what to say. Secondly, I just haven't seen Antifa before.  emerge anywhere since then. And so I offered a number of possibilities for why this happened.  that break with J6 and COVID. It actually happened sort of before J6. So first off, there was that Antifa just sort of got absorbed into BLM first. And then after COVID in 2023, just got absorbed into the pro-Palestinian anti-Israel protest. And so they sort of gave up their independence and gave up their ideology on behalf of you know blacks in america or palestinians abroad and so they sort of disappeared in a way because they weren't talking about anarchy and at least with palestine they weren't even exactly talking about racism i guess they sort of were they called israel racist but that was number two or three on the list of grievances or four or five  So that's one possibility. The other possibility is that they need funding. I don't think any of those people are rich. Some might be trust fund babies, but I don't think they're getting rich off being Antifa. And they just got their funding cut off. There actually were elite forces funding these people, even if it didn't take that much money. You can throw $10,000 at something and it will happen and it otherwise wouldn't have. Parts of the establishment wanted to oppose the alt-right, and thus they threw hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, I don't know, at Antifa as a countervailing force. And then they just cut it off because it got too radical. It was ruining the reputation of the left. They weren't going to run cover for Antifa, as they clearly did in 2016 and 2017. And they just cut it off. You're a bad look. Go away. Bye-bye.  That also strikes me as one. Being damaged by COVID itself, that might actually be part of it.  You know, these guys aren't exactly healthy. Another part, another one that I thought of was that it was a sort of millennial phenomenon. You know, like I was a little bit older than most of them. There were some old timer Antifa people, but I, at age 39 or whatever, like I was older than Antifa. They were millennials. And now...  Zoomers just don't want to do it. These millennials are now in their 40s, and they are just not up to going out in the streets. And the Zoomers are playing video games or streaming or watching extreme pornography and can't be bothered. So it's a generational thing. What else did I suggest? They joined the bourgeoisie. I don't know.  Well, I mean, they wear multiple hats. Like, I guess, you know, it's like someone who supports, I don't know, immigration restriction also supports like the pro-gun movement. And, you know, different things come up at different times and harassing people over the phone just fell out of vogue. I mean, you said it's a millennial thing. I mean, 2017 was ultimately the year of the millennials. You had Charlottesville...  And then you had Fyre Fest where millennials that had money lost it. And Charlottesville or millennials who didn't have money got in the street brawls. Yeah, I guess. Fyre Fest. That was that like concert that never happened. Yeah. They were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Their promise gourmet meals and they kept getting upselled.  And the guy's like out of jail and trying to do another one, but this time legit. I guess those street brawls were kind of a millennial thing. Yeah, definitely. And same with music festivals. Definitely. And it's just sort of over.  I think they were just effective. I mean, doesn't that just make the most sense? You could say that. You could say that they won, they destroyed the alt-right. I always get that thing of that meme of me saying I'm not doing the college tour because we were demonetized, so we didn't have money. We were getting into these fights that were just a bad look and dangerous, not what I wanted at all.  And so you could say they destroyed the alt-right. Now, I'm not destroyed. I keep going. But you could say that that earlier incarnation of me was won. That being said, haven't they just clearly lost the war and won a battle? Because the... The ideas of the alt-right seeped into the Trump movement in a way in which random people working for the campaign, random guys on YouTube or, you know, in some outer circle of MAGA, people getting hired by MAGA are some variation of an alt-right shitlord. and they've if if what they wanted to do was cut off the head of the snake that is me and nip it in the bud end it right there they have absolutely failed Clearly, I mean, I think MAGA is dumb, but clearly it is more open to racism and all sorts of other things, including anti-Semitism, than it was in 2014. I mean, it's just not even questionable. And for better and for worse, I would say, because it's we see a lot of dumb racism and anti-Semitism. Most of it, in fact, is dumb. But, you know, if if Antifa, if they were attempting to kind of police the right, then they have absolutely fundamentally failed. Well, I guess so effective was the wrong word because that made it sound like I was saying that they won the war kind of thing. I guess what I meant to say was that they were effective in their task, their individual task. Every time they kind of went out there in the street to combat the right wing. It was always a true anti-fascist kind of showing in the sense that these are people who are online who understand what someone who has a far-right ideology looks like versus a very run-of-the-mill MAGA supporter on J6. So when Trump supporters are saying they're going to show up to J6 and protest and stuff, I mean there's a lot of liberals that don't like that, but I think – The Antifa crowd, who are the ones who are well-researched online, are going to notice it for what it is, which is kind of not a true fascist kind of position. In other words, the only times that they showed up was when there was real fascism. I think that Trump is ineffective to bring this up right now because to what you said, that he could have been doing this nearly a decade ago. And it would have changed. I think it would have changed the world if he would have had this kind of stance. And if just Charlie Cook would have been assassinated eight years ago, I think that things would just look very different now. But we're so far into it that Antifa is not even a real organization. There's no real – it's not like they take names. There's not a list. It's not an organization. There's no membership.  I agree. There's no card carrying membership, but you could sort of say the same thing about what you could definitely say the same thing about white nationalism. And also, there's no doubt that there are funding channels. I mean, there were big accounts that were doxing, infiltrating right wing organizations, getting everyone's name, downloading the chat logs and counting how many times they said Hitler. I mean, it.  I just when when I see these liberal apologists and they're like, well, it's an idea. Well, yeah, I agree. It is an idea, but it's also an organization. I mean, maybe the mafia was an idea in some level, but it's also an organization. They must have been funded. And even if you say there's no money, there are individuals who donated so much time and energy, it's an in-kind funding source. And they can be targeted in that sense if they are going to be declared domestic extremist. Could they not just change their name and then... That's what I'm trying to say is that if you're a registered organization, a name change does not change the organization. But if you're not registered and you have no membership, a name change effectively does change everything. I mean the rules of being – calling them a domestic terrorist organization, I mean does that – what does that even mean if they just go under a different banner? Yeah.  Well, I mean, you're raising good questions. I don't know the answer to them. But I think the question that I'm more interested in is, where are they? I mean, to be fair to Antifa, I think Donald Trump is punching at shadows at this point. Like, I don't think there's an actual, there, there was something that could, that was, you know, incoherent, I guess, and diverse and dispersed, but you could fairly call Antifa, you know? um and you could probably put a list of 50 names who were antifa leaders and researchers and you could probably get a list of like 500 people i mean maybe it's very small in a way you could get a list of 500 people who were reliable for showing up in dc maybe new york maybe portland maybe la i don't know and it was a thing and it no longer is a thing and that's sort of my interest in all this i do believe those conspiracy theories about the bricks and stuff where people were saying that they were being funded with like weapons and whatnot i do i do find that very credible yeah definitely um apollo's aquarium  Hey, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. So this is more of a statement and I just wanted to hear your thoughts on it, but I wanted to push back on what regular guy was saying about the age of the millennial. He said something along the lines of like the festivals and things and like this or, you know, dead or whatever. And I'm actively at a festival right now. I mean, it's over for the night, but, I've been coming for about four years and there is probably double the amount of people from last year. And I don't want to dox myself, so I won't say the name, but my family owns a convention and like VIP tickets sold out within 17 minutes. And this is with all like most festivals and a lot of different big conventions. And  they are this big gathering of people for niche interests, but they're growing. And it's sort of, from what I've seen, like a lot of people's only like getting out in the public. And it's a lot of these sort of,  There's a lot of people types here. Yeah. Under the big skies here in Montana, I've never gone because it's like country music or something. But yeah, I mean, that is true. It gets bigger every year and it's sold out. People drive or fly from around the country. And yeah.  all over the world. I mean, that's, uh, yeah, but I think his, his point is sort of, I mean, like rock concerts are much, much more expensive than they were in the nineties. I mean, rock concerts now, I mean, like I, you're paying $200 for a ticket. I mean, Oh, and you can definitely pay $800, a thousand dollars for a ticket. Um,  In the 90s, you were paying like $29. So that's more than inflation or $17. But so there is there. But I just think it's sort of like an older mode of doing things. I think the Zoomers are...  they're just not, they're not like festival goers. There is something inherently millennial about like Coachella or something, or I just don't think the Zoomers are going to be into it. I mean, I think it is different.  Well, I'll push back a little bit. So this one... Well, we don't need to get into an argument about this. That's fine, that's fine. But there are a lot of young people that go to these sites. Okay. So I would push back on that, but that's all I wanted to say. I just wanted to know what you thought. Sure. Okay, Apollo's Aquarium? I just talked. Oh, sorry. Henry Wells? Yeah, I was curious your take on Suentes'  kind of shift in tone after the Charlie Kirk assassination. I feel like before that, he was kind of detached from everything, almost like in a monk-like way. You know, he was above it all and he could criticize a lot of these elements, you know, Trump, Candace Tucker. But I feel like after the assassination, he's gotten, he's kind of more of a man in the arena now. He's trying to get people to take action and he's, He's also starting to more directly attack the left, whereas I felt like before he was almost manifesting the horseshoe theory in a way, like he was kind of getting the left and the right to agree on certain issues like Israel and Trump and so forth. Yeah, he was he was attacking the right and in some ways running cover for the left. because you're you know like i i would i'll just assume this i i haven't seen him say this exactly but i would imagine that what he would say about a lot of deportations is that they're getting rid of critics of israel and it's not going to make a huge difference and that's what this is all about now he does seem more engaged I mean, I'll just say another thing on this matter, which is that, and I think because Nick is like me, he can get out in front. I think... i think nick is listening to me um i'll just say that but maybe he's not uh but he's able to understand consequences and get out in front of an issue and i think he's unable to understand dynamics so what am i saying here so 10 years ago or let's go back 20 years to 9 11. if you said that 9 11 is a waste of money and manpower and it's going to take away unnecessarily thousands of lives in the middle east it's a distraction etc that was sort of the above board liberal critique or maybe even libertarian critique of the iraq war  If you said it's all about oil, that was getting a little more lefty. You were calling it out. You were doing materialist analysis. If you said that that war was about Israel, you would be denounced by the far left. And people would probably look at you with their mind boggle they wouldn't get it average people and the far right wasn't even going there outside of some circles so  That's how it was 20 years ago. It was a different time, you understand. And so to actually engage in serious criticism of Israel and to not just historical criticism, but to bring it to how it's affecting your life, American foreign policy right now, that was super edgy. And I think Nick recognizes this because Nick wants to be and he wants to differentiate himself. He wants to be the man, not just a man in the arena, but like the man, the incarnation of America first or whatever. He's noticed something that I've noticed as well. which is that now there is a cottage industry where everyone and his sister are declaring that Israel did this and Israel is uniquely evil and quoting the Talmud and basically claiming that Charlie Kirk shot, excuse me, that basically claiming that Benjamin Netanyahu shot Charlie Kirk himself.  And there's a big gamut of that. There are Twitter schizos like Lucas Gage or whatever. There's Candace Owens, who has a huge audience. There's Tucker Carlson, who is insinuating all of these things, even though I think some of the people interviewing him don't even quite know what he's saying but he's basically insinuating this line and you saw you know my guy uh what's his name ian carroll being like yeah so you know i was on the phone with candace owens and uh  And Tucker and Max Blumenthal. I'm an evil ski instructor. It's who I am. And we were like, yeah, let's do this. Let's do it. So Ian Carroll was announcing to the world the Russian network that he is a part of.  I have no other words. So there's like the mainstream part of it, Tucker. There's the somewhat schizo part of it, or schizo part of it, which is Candace. There's the Rogan sphere conspiracy theorist, which is him. There's the Jewish leftist, which is Max Boomethal. And oh, surprise, surprise. They're all working together, promoting the same story, not stepping on anyone's toes, whatever. So  Yeah, this didn't exist 20 years ago. This didn't exist 10 years ago. And I think Nick recognizes that there is this money-making sphere of grifters and Russian assets that... The moment you slip on a banana peel or you suffer from male pattern baldness, they're going to blame it on Israel. And it's not that they're being policed as they were 20 years ago. In fact, on social media, they're getting rewarded for it. So there's just an incentive to engage in dumbass anti-Semitism constantly.  That incentive was not even close to being real 20 years ago. It now is here. And so now it's time for Nick, I mean, I do this anyway, but Nick recognizes that now it's time for him to differentiate himself from these fucking retards. Or it's just someone like Tucker who's just,  He's slimy. He's bullshitty. He stands for nothing. He's annoying. Candace Owens is genuinely crazy. I hope she seeks help. Ian Carroll is kind of funny around the edges, but he is what he is. Max Blumenthal is a i from what i can tell a former genuine leftist maybe reacting against his liberal father to some degree who's been anti-israel for a long time but the gray zone is now part of the gray zone and it's just a russian operation so do you want to go down with that ship or do you want to differentiate yourself and say look  We don't know what happened. There are lots of problems with the FBI's narrative, as we can go into. But I'm going to differentiate myself from Lucas Gage and Ian Carroll and Candace Owens by just being, like, reasonable. Yeah.  It's not hard. And you can call out the Jews, as they say. I don't do that. But you can engage in serious criticism of Judaism, the Bible, Israel, Netanyahu. You can do all of that. But don't do the schizo shit because it very likely is wrong. And secondly, why even bother? I don't want to compete with Lucas Gage.  He's a fucking peasant. Nick knows that. Do you want to associate yourself with someone who's doing transvestigations? I mean, no. So Nick sees the big picture. What do you think, though, about his decision? Because before, I mean, he was almost uniquely talented. I don't know if I could think of someone else who's been so successful in pulling people, pulling an audience from both the left and the right.  And now he's kind of shifted towards directly attacking the left. I see. You're talking about—I understand your question. You're saying over the past, like, three to six months? Because I think that's where this trend started. Like, you find these, like, liberals on TikTok doing dances to Nick Fuentes or something. Yeah, that's an interesting thing. He is talented in that way. There's no doubt about it. Maybe uniquely talented. um but i the tide has turned yeah i do see him more as a right-wing figure now and i think that's yeah that's important but you know times change and stay relevant uh pareto Yeah, so I was on Twitter for like the past few days and I noticed all these different kind of like posts by the American Communist Party. People like that. What was that guy? Jackson Hinkle. Something is Aldean logo. And they're all kind of like pointing fingers at Fuentes and saying like he's a he's a Zionist. He's paid by Israel. And yeah, there's all these. different it's so confusing like are they backed by russia uh and and i and i'll be honest do you think that maybe the communist party might be funded by russia like are you willing to yeah but i feel like i know no no i i don't know it probably is but i just it's so simple but it's just kind of it's just so kind of convincing i i don't know yeah let's just play this uh i just found this to be hilarious actually um poor little jackson uh here i'll share sound so this is him with sneak up now can someone can someone find this full video and maybe put in the chat because this is 53 seconds  And I don't know if we're misrepresenting poor Jackson here. Is this just taken out of context? It doesn't sound like it, actually. Let's play it. I, I consider Marxism as like, uh, uh, not to get like nerdy, but it's like a science of how you interpret the world and, um, see our problems. So you see the same problems, but maybe you just different solutions, not even different solutions. You just get there in a different way of seeing the problems, you know? So what's the point of Marxism? Like, uh, like I think get nerdy with it. I want to, I really want you to, uh, I want to understand your communist point of view. um well i mean you take the science of dialectical materialism and it's like you you look at the world in a way that so like you look at the way the world operates in the sense that like i i don't know maybe we're not the same you who do you think  OK, so clearly Jackson Hinkle has read Hegel. He's read the entirety of Marx. I mean, that was a very capital, very well thought. Yeah. OK, so Marxism or dialectical materialism, whatever it is, the application of class analysis to world history. so that you can understand that dynamic in the past and make predictions for the future it's very easy to say that like i don't i mean i don't even know what to say this kid has a high school diploma to his name and is clearly not an autodidact so the question is why is he even calling himself a marxist and i yeah i think i'm almost doing him a favor by claim by suggesting or hypothesizing that he's a russian asset it would almost be worse if he were genuine because then he's just a idiot but if he's a russian asset then it's sort of devious if you know what i mean but like this is also just runs the lake zionist i think zionist power comes from the people who run the world ah okay the people marxism is an analysis of capitalism there's no there are no evil people running the world those evil people are sort of equally trapped Within capitalism and in the historical progress as the laborer who's left off, who's laid off and is now starving. They're all equally crapped in this process.  It's not like Marxism is like, oh, Jeff Bezos bad or something. And then Sneeko's like, I too hate Jeff Bezos. You know, we're together. This is so fucking dumb. I cannot put it into words.  And it's just populism. Populism, I mean, it's hard to define it, but an important component of populism is that there is an evil elite preventing the flourishing of the people. I think everyone would agree with that, right? So this is just populism. You don't need Marx. Marx would fucking laugh at this person. Stalin would kill this person.  I really hate Jackson Hinkle maybe more than I hate anyone else. He is just uniquely contemptible. And the idea that, like, he's a Leninist Marxist, so he has the best Jewish conspiracy theories. And this is sort of, I think this is an apocryphal quote, I think. But it's basically that anti-Semitism is socialism for idiots. Right.  Marx might have actually said that. I think it's a paraphrase. Regardless. And what the point of that quote is that you're not engaging in class analysis. What you're doing is seeing that there are evil Jews running the bank, so we should kill said evil Jews and take their money. That is socialism for idiots from the standpoint of a Marxist.  A Marxist wants to end the division of labor and fundamentally transform the world. A populist retard like Jackson Hinkle thinks there are bad people, but apparently he's not anti-Semitic because there's even badder people behind the Zionist. And the Zionists are the ones controlling the Jews. The Jews are like victims and  The Jews are controlling Hollywood and we're victims. I don't even know. I remember seeing this meme in 2016 where it was like there was the Ameriburger who was on like an obesity wheelchair and someone was like had a a fishing rod where he was holding a hamburger in front of this like American. And then like the Jewish capitalist was holding like a money bag in front of him. And then like the lizard people were holding like like a saturn uh you know in front of the jews i it's just it was totally schizo but like that's it was like the reptiles are behind it all that's how jackson hinkle thinks he is that dumb he is not a marxist he's not even a marxist  Did anyone find, like, the full clip of that? Or is he, like, taking it down in embarrassment? Richard, that should probably be on, like, Sneeko's Rumble channel in, like, 2023. I watched this when it came out, and I remember being not impressed by Jackson Hinkle. And, you know, Sneeko, who I don't think is, like, a brilliant mind, but you could see even he was, like, wanted to hear his political theory. Yeah. Here at Broken Down, Sneeko, for what he is, has had pretty in-depth conversations with people like Nick and Destiny, people who can expand the worldview. Even the Red Pill dudes can explain their worldview to you, no matter how stupid it is. They can explain it, but Hinkle, he can't even do that. no all right let's just go to it really i don't want to waste too much time on this but i i have this sneaking i don't i'm too fair i just don't i don't want to misrepresent oh god okay no i'm not shoe brands have been lying to you god i know why nobody believed me at first but now everyone wants a pair how many ah oh this is not an ad  Do you think, Chad, do you think that you could, some people want me to convert you to Islam? That was a big reason why I wanted to have you on the stream for a while, is that a lot of the, like, you're, I don't really think you understand asking these questions. I don't think you understand how much of an impact you're making with the Islamic community. I think how long he is with his face. Sometimes people say, I'm this, I'm that, I'm that. Sometimes people say, he changed his whole life. I was even drinking at the meetup. What's it like? With Israel-Palestine? Yeah. Yeah.  I think they're, I think it's both. I think that it's, we say do art when you make a prayer, everybody, they go to a, you know, they go to, um, what's the fucking search with the B, whatever it's fucking called. You know what I'm talking about? They go, they go do the,  Chad will know. So to the B I, instead of mother Mary holding Jesus, it was a grown Jesus holding a baby mother Mary. It was like all twisted and back where I'm like, we got to get out of here as soon as possible. So why were you in Cuba to begin with? uh i wanted to go i was just like i just moved to miami and i'm like cuba's pretty close let's go to cuba and i got cuban cigars that was the main thing so okay okay so it's also yeah 100 let's all trigger zirka kosovo so never forget  So they hate NATO. There's like the UAE, Saudis to say, hey. Do you know what I've noticed? I think I mentioned this with Jackson Hinkle earlier. It's all these just like, we stand with the Muslims. We stand with Russia. It's this like... idiotic assertion of teams you know that he thinks is like analysis of the world like yeah we hate nato it's like okay great you know i hate the new york yankees i mean what's your point let me get i i just want to find this section  I want to see him win, but it's probably the most decisive election. Look, let me stop doing this. This is bad television. I'm going to put the link to this in the chat. If anyone can find it, that would be great. I wish you could search the text like you can with YouTube. But this is bad television, me just searching for this. He's an idiot. um pareto oh do i have my hands up or oh i guess you already oh sorry yeah yeah all right i think we nailed the antifa issue um uh oh let me just play this video here um i put it in the scratch pad  And this is worth talking. I think it will inspire some. This is worth talking about. I think it will inspire some discussion. Let's see this. I think this is it. Yeah. Okay. Let me share the screen here. So what the FBI is also telling you is that he reassembled the rifle before he dumped it in the bushes. As he's fleeing the scene of a murder, how did he reassemble the rifle if he accidentally left his screwdriver up on the roof? This guy's a badass. Guns, CrossFit, little cardio.  Welcome back to the channel, everybody. I know it's been a few days. I've been out of town, but it's actually given me an opportunity to let the FBI complete its full official story regarding the Charlie Kirk situation. And man, it's an interesting story to say the least. That's what we're going to do in this video.  No tinfoil hat, no conspiracy. We are just going to go from start to finish with the official story put out by the FBI and see if any of it actually makes sense together. So don't forget to like, comment, subscribe. It helps the channel. Follow us on Patreon. grab some merch let's jump into this thing we're gonna start at the beginning now there's a philosophical theory called occam's razor that when you're presented with multiple different possible scenarios that could explain something typically the one that's least complicated and requires the least assumptions is the one that's most often true is the effect Occam's razor is about not multiplying variables in your explanation, but the simplest answer is usually the best is what people think it is. I won't dwell on this. It's fine. I sort of agree with this version of Occam's razor, but... official fbi's narrative the one that's the least complicated and requires the least amount of assumptions i'd say no i'd say it's the one that requires the most amount of assumptions let's jump into it all right we're gonna start at the start of the timeline work our way through it and just as we go talk about some things that just don't quite make sense  All right, first, the shooter. Where did he come from? So, at first, we heard that he actually went to this school. Then, as far as we know now, he actually went to a different school about three hours away in Utah. So, yes, this kid drove up for the event, apparently somehow pre-scouted the entire area. knew exactly where he needed to be in park to be able to get onto this roof, get in the exact perfect position he needed to to take the shot. Okay, that's fine. We can assume that's not that outrageous of a theory. Then, according to the FBI, we got to get into, as he gets to the event, his clothing situation. A lot of supposed clothes changes in a weird timeline that doesn't make sense. I'll let the FBI talk about it, though. So when he's first spotted on campus, he has different clothing on, and then he changes clothing on the roof and then changed back into that clothing at some point so that when he was apprehended, when he was arrested, the clothing matched the clothing he had on before the shooting here at UB. right so we're off to a great start right so the suspect arrives in some clothing he changes that clothing puts it in i'm assuming this tiny little backpack where he's also got a broken down 30-06 we'll get into that in a second uh climbs to the roof changes his clothing takes the shot and we're going to get to the roof timeline of events here in a minute uh changes back out of that clothing and then flees and escapes the scene all right so more clothing changes than taylor swift concert sure look  We'll say that makes sense. What the FBI has also told us is, of course, that this is the suspect's murder weapon. All right, this Mauser 30-06 that they found later that day. Okay, again, this one, I've never believed this from the beginning, and we're going to get into why here as we move through the timeline of events.  He supposedly, he changes his clothes. Now, a lot of people were trying to say that he hid this rifle in his jeans. Okay, well, let's take a look at what a .30-06 looks like stuffed in a pair of pants. All right, so courtesy of one of our viewers, yes, as you can see, what does an actual .30-06 look like stuffed in, actually, kind of a pair of loose-fitting pants? Absolutely outrageous, ridiculous. So, no, it wasn't just stuffed in this kid's tiny little skinny jeans. We know that. So the FBI then says, well, yes, he disassembled this .30-06 and he put it in his tiny little backpack, which I'm not even sure how the barrel fits in that backpack. All right, sure, let's just pretend that this kid is David Blaine Jr. and he somehow has a fully broken down .30-06 in this tiny little backpack that he has with, of course, his change of clothing on top of it. Also, the tools to put together and take apart this weapon. He gets to the top of the roof, and as you heard the FBI say there, he changes his clothes when he gets on top of the roof. He reassembles his rifle. The FBI says we know that's what he did because the FBI found the screwdriver he used to reassemble the rifle, and it matches the DNA to the shooter. Okay, let's see that statement. All right, so yes, here we go from FBI Director Cash Patel, himself a real winner in this entire situation. Tells us the DNA found on a towel wrapped in the woods with the .30-06 matches that of the shooter. Also, that the DNA linked to Tyler Robinson with a screwdriver recovered from the rooftop. That's going to be important here in just a second. was also recovered all right so quick recap because we got to stay in our timeline here because it's all over the place uh so the kid shows up he changes his clothes he's got his broken down 30-06 in his backpack in this magic houdini backpack that's fitting all this crazy in it uh he gets to the top of the roof he changes his clothes he reconstructs the rifle with this screwdriver that the fbi found okay then of course we see him take the shot and in the chaos we see that first video of him immediately sprinting across the roof right after that shot we then see him flee out the back all right and i want you guys to pay attention to this so if you see my cursor right here on the left this is where the fbi says he took the shot from okay we then see him immediately sprint along the front of this from that front viewed camera and sprint around this right off the back as we've seen there he goes he zooms in a lot of people are trying to say he's got a rifle with him we're gonna see here in a second that's just silly he jumps down throws his backpack picks his backpack up which looks like his hat he actually does because right here you see this hat comes back on the head  He has nothing in his left arm, only the backpack in his right arm. You can see here, if this kid had a giant .30-06 somehow, people are going to see it. But what he has is a backpack.  Again, there's pedestrians, there's cars, there's everybody like right in front of him. Nobody's freaking out. This kid's walking around with a giant rifle right after a gunshot, right? What the FBI said is a deconstructed rifle in his backpack. All right, let's play a hypothetical. And again, this is literally the FBI story. So this kid was able to take the shot, change his clothes, break down with the screwdriver he used and left on the roof to put it back in his backpack and all in about six seconds as he sprints across in one sort of continuous frame there to leave the scene. Okay, okay, okay, fine, FBI. Sure, let's say that's all somehow true. Well, what's the problem that we just ran into now? Well, that screwdriver he used to disassemble and reassemble the weapon, FBI, you found it on the roof. He left it on the roof. So when he's fleed out into the bushes where you found his .30-06 in the woods, let's take a look at that .30-06, that weapon is completely assembled. So what the FBI is also telling you is that he reassembled the rifle before he dumped it in the bushes. As he's fleeing the scene of a murder, how'd he reassemble the rifle if he accidentally left his screwdriver up on the roof?  Well, he had another screwdriver in his car. But I agree that... How come you announced that he had another screwdriver in his car or he bought a screwdriver? But I do agree that they're making you do too much explaining. DNA matches a towel found in the woods and the screwdriver, but you didn't say that the DNA matches the rifle.  That seems like what you would want to match. I don't know. Kind of odd. Let's talk about the shot itself. Because, again, I've said from the very beginning I didn't believe this was a .30-06 based off of the official narrative is that Charlie Kirk was shot from about 150 to 200 yards with a .30-06 round. And we've all seen the footage, I'm sure, by now.  None of that ever made sense to me, and I'm going to show you why. So we racked our brains back and forth about, did Charlie have body armor? Did he not have it on? We've run through the timeline of events and pretty much 100% confirmed at this point, no, Charlie did not have body armor on. So what does that mean? The official FBI story means that he took a direct impact to soft tissue in the neck near the carotid from a 30-06 round from 150 meters. Okay.  Let's look at a little demonstration. All right, guys, this is going to be an actual ballistics demonstration of what a 30-06 round does to a mock gel human skull, okay? And these are literally designed to see what ballistics actually do to the human body. This is a 30-06 round. Let's take a watch. Okay. Okay. So we are supposed to believe that a 30-06 round from about 150 meters to soft human flesh, and it's not like Charlie Kirk was some linebacker, not that it would matter, some giant neck or anything, had that fairly small wound as you still frame the pictures. So here's the actual still frame. Again, the FBI wants you to believe that that wound right there is an entrance wound.  from a 30-06 round, which we just saw demonstrated, and there was no exit wound. Okay. You know, people say, well, bullets do funny things. Yeah, that would have been real, real funny, right? You guys realize the entire back of that tent, that white tent, would have just been painted with Charlie's blood just absolutely everywhere had that been a 30-06 round. Again,  FBI's story, not mine. So as we move through the timeline of events, yes, the kid escapes. And in the chaos, we have some very odd things happen. We have that old man immediately cause a huge distraction saying that he's the shooter. Very odd. The FBI then, of course, immediately announces that, what, four...  I can believe that that is totally happenstantial or coincidental. I can believe that there are weirdo antifa boomers who are like, I did it, I did it. Yeah, I can believe that actually. 4.21 PM, we got him. Cash Patel says, we got him, boys. About an hour and a half later, says we don't got him. Actually got a good meme for this. Got the guy. Oh shit, did you really? Nope, not the guy. Oh, okay.  This is the guy. Oh shit, fuck you. Oh wait, nope, not that guy. What? What are we doing right now? I got a picture of the guy. Yeah, how am I supposed to know that's the guy?  Shit, wait, how do I know that's the guy? All right, I'll see you in Valhalla, jokes aside. Yes, so the FBI thinks they got him, they don't got him. They thinks they got him, they don't got him, right? Then they find the murder weapon in the woods later that night, supposedly, I guess. Then, and again, I have to keep telling you this. This is the FBI's narrative, not mine. This kid goes through all this work, planning and preparation, pulls this thing off, gets away. gets in his car, drives all the way back home, and immediately confesses to his pastor father, who the FBI told us was a retired sheriff, turns out was never in law enforcement, apparently owns a construction business. I don't know. Immediately, confesses and is turned in by his father, who is now gonna receive a $1 million reward from Bill Ackman for turning in his son. Okay, so we got the shooter in custody, and of course now we need motives, we need reasons.  Um, because again, he carries this entire thing out. He confesses, admits it to his father, supposedly admits it on discord, even though discord is saying that that username and those messages don't actually exist. Even the FBI, even though the FBI is saying that, um, And after confessing to all these people, turning himself into his father, he gets apprehended by the FBI, who is still saying as of right now that he's refusing to cooperate or admit to the crime. Okay. All right. But don't worry, because the FBI, of course, already has the text messages between him and his furry boyfriend or whatever the hell this is. And yeah, let's take a look at those. Okay.  Keep in mind, these are Gen Z kids. Do you guys, any of you have kids that are Gen Z or around kids that are Gen Z? Do you know how they talk? Skibbity toilet riz? Okay. But yeah, let's look at this conversation. Let's see what it says. Drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard. What? You're joking, right? I'm still okay, my love. Stuck an arm for a little while longer yet.  Shouldn't be long until I come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. That's a good thing to admit to. To be honest, I'd hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. Sorry to involve you. You weren't the one to do it right. I am. Sorry. What fucking Gen Z kid talks like that? Really? It just happens to admit to everything? The rifle? That he did it? On a text message?  that you would know the FBI would immediately get ahold of. So that's the official FBI story. Let's just recap it real quick, right? So this kid drives from three hours away, supposedly knows everything about this college campus, exactly where to enter from, where to go on the building. He must've pre-scattered it somewhere. Got it. He shows up, changes his clothes, has his broken down 30-06 rifle and a change of clothes on this tiny little black backpack, gets to the roof, changes his clothes, reassembles the rifle with the screwdriver, takes the shot, disassembles the rifle, Changes his clothes, runs and jumps off the building, runs out into the woods, reassembles the rifle without the screwdriver that he needed to because he left it on the roof, gets away, drives all the way home and immediately confesses. But then now won't cooperate with the FBI. That's the FBI story.  Got it. Got it, guys. This is the same FBI that is continuing to lie and cover up the Epstein files. I mean, Kash Patel just came out and said today that he doesn't believe Epstein trafficked children to anybody. So, okay, this is where we're at. That's this FBI, right?  Again, I get it. Some people out there really trust the government. And if the FBI says it, it must be true. Guys, when we talked about the start of this and Occam's razor, does this story, is this the simplest story with the least amount of assumptions needed? No, this story is ridiculous.  Now, like I said, this isn't going to be a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory video. I'm just was going to show you the timeline of events. So we all have the actual FBI story here. That'll probably be the next video I'll do where I give my real opinions on this. But there's also some other anomalies I think we need to look at because there's some things I'm wondering, like, why the hell aren't we receiving this information? Here's the first one.  We know that there was this camera set up right behind Charlie. Multiple videos of that camera showing Charlie from behind as he's interacting with the crowd. But now we can't get the footage to this camera for some reason. This camera would show everything we need to know. Where's the exit wound? Maybe the actual trajectory of the round. Maybe hit here. That was the exit wound.  Well, this footage might tell us that. Here's the other thing. Wouldn't the FBI be pretty interested in the coroner's report, the autopsy report? That would tell us everything we would know. It would tell us the ballistics used, the entrance location, the exit location. Everything, there's pretty much every question we need answered about that side of the story is right there. And that just doesn't seem to exist. It doesn't seem like we're going to get that information. That's pretty odd. All right, so here's the deal, guys, is the end of it. You can call me a conspiracy theorist, a tinfoil hat, and you should trust the government. You should trust the FBI. I'm sorry. I don't think I'm even reaching on any of this. I'm just literally going through the FBI's timeline of events  and trying to objectively say, do these things make sense? Is this possible? And no, I don't see how anybody can look at that full timeline of events put out by the FBI, right? Could this actually be the shooter and all these things? Maybe, but the FBI has done such a horrible job at reporting all this that it makes the entire thing look like a massive conspiracy. Okay. I think that's enough. Um,  I think he raises a lot of genuine questions. I have a sort of theory about the text messages.  There was this guy, I think I retweeted this. Let me just read his tweet on the text message chain between Lance Twiggs and Tyler Robinson.  Yeah, so this is some Rothbardian here. Rothbard, 1776. I try not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I have a really hard time believing in a short text exchange. The alleged shooter makes his confession, confirms location of the weapon, confirms the type of weapon, confirms it was wrapped in a towel, confirms his motive, exonerates the decoy, George Zen, admits to the bullet engravings, confirms the wardrobe change, confirms how long he's been planning it, discloses the existence of location of a now destroyed pre-written confession note, randomly tells his boyfriend that his dad is diehard MAGA, as if he wouldn't already know given the nature of the relationship, and is worried about the dad grandpa being upset if he doesn't come home with the rifle, not the fact that he had just used it to commit a murder. That last one, I would say, I disagree with slightly just in the sense that he would know that his grandpa would... know that he committed the murder if he can't produce that weapon and or or suspect that he committed the murder if he can't produce the weapon  Not to mention a 22-year-old terminally online Zoomer using phrases like squad car. I agree with that. Drop point, swept the area, my vehicle. I know Louisiana, you see a lot of people use my vehicle. I do think that a Zoomer would use car or my ride, maybe, because Zoomers are passive. They're just riding. They're being driven.  Uh, till I died of old age, I sort of agree. My old man, maybe that was ironic. Um, I mean,  You could say, and I retweeted something to this effect today. I mean, maybe this is a terminally online Zoomer who's saying like, m'lady to his furry boyfriend or something. So you could sort of explain it in that way. There's a little, there's an ironic tinge to my old man.  But I mean, we read this on Tuesday. My initial impression was that there's it's too much. It's an orgy of evidence. It's a script. I don't know. I just I have a lot of problems with this. I do have a theory about it, which I'll just offer, which is that. Let's say it's scripted.  So did the FBI script this? So this is like a Gen X police officer in Utah, or maybe a federal, a fed, an FBI guy, scripted this in order to tie up all loose ends, give the prosecutor everything, basically motive and a confession,  It would be open and shut case. If the FBI were caught doing that, they they have to in the discovery process, they have to give over all of the stuff to the other side. If this guy has a lawyer worth his weight and salt, even a public defender.  And they start contesting this discovery and saying, he never did this. Look, we can have a digital footprint of your phone. Your phone is like an investigation device. You know, if you murder someone with your phone on, like...  You're cooked. It knows where you are, what you're doing, when you open it, how fast you're driving. I mean, it has logged everything. So I don't think they can get away with it, actually. And even if there's a 1% chance that they couldn't get away with it, I mean, the FBI would be cooked for generations. I mean, it would just be a devastating... scandal beyond all scandals but so maybe it is true maybe the fbi is making this up okay but there is another possibility and there's a possibility that lance twigs and robinson did this together, they sort of made this all too perfect confession in order to tie up loose ends because it does exonerate Lance because Lance apparently found a confession note. I don't know why you would write a note like I killed Charlie Kirk on a note that's now destroyed. That raises a lot of questions.  So they have a text report on the note, but the note's gone. Anyway, why? Did he throw it away? Isn't that obstruction of justice? I don't know. But they could have scripted this themselves in order to pin all blame onto Tyler Robinson, exonerate Lance Twiggs of really anything.  And they're basically responding to stuff they're seeing in the media. And even in this exchange, which seems kind of dubious, it's clear that they're following this case avidly. The other option is that Lance Twiggs wrote this. And...  Here's how you can do it. I remember reading about this case, or maybe I saw it on Dr. Grande or whatever, but there was a man who killed his girlfriend and he went to her house, killed her, and then with her phone created the perfect alibi. So he had a conversation between the two phones that he was writing. He was writing on her phone.  and then responding to it. And it would be like, oh, can I come over? Oh, yeah, sure. So he created this fictional script digitally after he had killed his girlfriend, I believe is what it was. So... What if Lance Twiggs created this false script himself using their phones, which he had access to being that they were roommates? And he wants to totally exonerate himself for whatever reason. And maybe that's why Tyler Robinson isn't cooperating. Just a theory.  What do you guys think? Bickus? I was just going to ask what you make of in the messages. Him saying that his dad was texting him asking for pictures of the gun. I thought that was kind of strange. Yeah, I mean, I guess you could explain that as...  they were already suspecting Robinson, and so they were like, show me that you have the gun. But even then, that's just sort of weird, don't you think? Yeah, very much so. It wasn't his dad, I think, wasn't it his grandfather? That makes it even weirder. I think it was his grandpa's gun, but I think his dad was asking for a picture. His dad wanted photos.  So his dad already suspected him is what that implies, at least to me. Yeah, or it seems like he at least knew that he already had possession of this gun. Yeah.  I mean, I think we said this on Tuesday. If you're going to murder someone and you want to get away with it, which he claims is what he wants to do, then why are you possibly using a weapon that is traceable to your family? And he says, I don't know if it has a serial number. and it's not mine it's like it do you honestly think that as a 22 year old if they trace the gun to your grandfather they're not gonna look they probably don't think he did it you know they're gonna look to you i mean or they're gonna ask who's had possession of this gun so it's it's just i i don't know there's just so many i i'm i too like resist these conspiracy theories but this is just bad strange i also don't buy the notion that he was just this well-adjusted normal person and then over the course of like a year or two he becomes some psycho that goes like shoot someone in the neck i don't i don't i don't think that really happens usually i think there's probably indicators that his parents would have  picked up on that he was some kind of weird ass. Yeah. And who, who was the weird ass? Remember Lance twigs got kicked out of his house by his father, which is a pretty rude thing to do, but his father just found him. This is reported in the New York time or New York post because his father found him disrespectful. He didn't like the transition thing or didn't like the homosexuality, et cetera. So,  I don't know. I'm just throwing it out there in a funny way. I don't think this points to this theory that I have doesn't point towards Israel or Russia or any big geopolitical actor. It actually is part of the trans terror issue that that the conservatives really like. Which is that I wonder if Lance Twiggs is manipulating this innocent, intelligent, but just from what I can tell from his photos and things like that, sort of naive autist. Yeah, I kind of got special ed vibes from him.  A little bit, yeah. Maybe not that bad. Yeah, but there was that video his mom had posted on Facebook of him reading off a scholarship letter or something. I got that vibe from his kids. Still, that was like a $30,000 scholarship, which is pretty good. I mean, pretty remarkable, in fact. Yeah. Well, I guess, I mean, not in the sense that he's a retard, but in the sense that he's off. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, he's not Gypsy Rose as a low functioning artist. I think he's a high functioning artist, but he does. I'm just judging this purely on the photographs. My just impression of him. He doesn't. And and even the text messages, even though I'm bringing those into question, he just sort of he does not strike me as a psychopath. He strikes me as an as a sort of autistic nerd type. and yeah maybe you could say the perfect patsy um but and i'm not even questioning that he did it in this scenario what i'm questioning is whether this confession is a manipulation by an actual psychopath or dark narcissist like uh lance twigs  Yeah, someone was saying that's what Gypsy Rose did. Yeah, Gypsy Rose was this autistic girl. I believe she convinced her boyfriend to kill her own mother. Her own mother, who was highly abusive and sort of deserved it, to be honest. It was just a shit show all the way around. But nevertheless, she was manipulating him to do that on her behalf.  Austin? Yes, Richard. I think you've tapped into probably what happened. Twigs, probably, yeah. This sounds like you've tapped into a very psychological thing that happened between them two. And Twigs is going to come out clean. You got to do one to no one. I'm channeling my inner Ian Carroll.  That's a great take. Psycho ski instructor. Because he's clean. He's a free man. Nothing's going to happen to him. I know. He scapegoated his autistic lover. Wow. Wow. Henry?  Yeah, I agree. It seems like he was groomed by his lover. I'm curious what you think about this photo that Candace has released. I mean, given that it's coming from her, it'd be dubious, but showing him at Dairy Queen at like 640 or something. Oh, Candace released that? I did see that photo of him at Dairy Queen. Or is she just promoting it? She released it herself? Yeah.  I read that she was a source. I don't know if that's confirmed. Okay. Let me just look this up. Oh, yeah, I think she did. Let me just share this real quick. Wow, she's got someone in there. Let's hear what she has to say about this. Okay, let's get... why is that going so fast let me just slow it down a little bit age of tyler robinson allegedly taken i'll say allegedly for safety here but it's looking right according to my timeline allegedly taken at 6 38 p.m at a nearby dairy queen here is that photo that we can show you take a look at this photo  What is wrong with this picture? A lot is wrong with this picture. I don't think she understands what the word allegedly means, but I'll just let that pass. That does look a lot like him, and that's the description in the maroon shirt, so okay. first and foremost 6 38 p.m you just shot someone uh you have gone through great pains to hide your face to change your outfit but wait you didn't fully change your outfit did you i'm looking at this photo and uh you're wearing jeans and you're wearing the maroon shirt now we have a 50 50 combo of the outfits and now you're showing your eyes and you're not fearful at all that you might be recognized the only problem is that actually a lot of psycho killers have done stuff like this um Sorry to bring up Chris Watts again, but there are photos just like this the morning after he murdered his family where he's at a convenience store buying gum or some crazy thing or a breakfast. So a psychopath would do this, actually. Well, it's what Luigi did. Yeah, I should have used the example of Luigi, yeah. He's eating hash browns.  I had a hash brown this morning from McDonald's. I'll have to confess. Maybe in honor of Luigi. Not really. I hate that guy, but they do have tasty hash browns. Luigi was correct about one thing.  Also, wow, you must have quite the stomach. You don't have a record. Next thing you know, you shoot someone and you're like, I'm just image of Tyler Robinson through great pains to hide your face to change. I'm looking at this photo and you're wearing jeans and you're wearing the maroon shirt. Now we have a 50-50 combo of the outfits and now you're showing your eyes and you're not fearful at all that you might be recognized. Also, wow, you must have quite the stomach. You don't have a record. Next thing you know, you shoot someone and you're like, I'm just image of Tyler Robinson.  I don't think her analysis is very good. That's interesting, though. Someone in the chat, she's just describing a picture as if we don't have eyes.  All right. We can watch some more about the ballistics. What do you guys think of, I mean, again, I'm basically going with the official report that there was one shooter.  But I also think that these guys, Valhalla is one. There's another one called, like, Beyond the Overton or something. And they are promoting the idea that the wound in the neck was an exit wound from, like, a .38 caliber pistol or something, as opposed to this massive... uh shell traveling at 3 000 miles per hour over 400 feet and i don't know i'm sort of i'm trying to resist these things it's like we have the zaprooter film immediately after the jfk assassination and it's blasted everywhere so i don't know i i have to say though as and also as someone who owns a gun and i'm you know  I'm able to use guns. I'm not a gun guy, so I'm not going to come out and give some definitive expert opinion, but...  I don't know. I mean, I saw what I saw. The 30-06 is going to just turn you into pink mush. And the fact is, the wound seemed much smaller coming out of the side of his neck. I don't know. I have questions, too. I would like to see an autopsy. Now, questioning that, what I did earlier, I have a theory about the scripted letter, the scripted text exchange. That doesn't destroy the idea that Tyler is the murderer. Questioning how he was shot definitely does. That is starting to suggest a conspiracy of some kind. So I don't know.  What do you guys think? Someone said it seemed like a .22, a .22 caliber? Wow. Someone said that in the chat. What do you guys... Does anyone have any opinion on this? I do agree that the .30-06 round should do more damage and you should see an exit wound. That's why I think... the bounced off the plate theory about this whole situation is why I think you have to consider it because going to say that a 30-06 didn't go through his neck or leave him splattered, then really the only way that's possible is if it hit a plate, which people say he was wearing one. People say he wasn't. But if it did, then maybe it lost enough energy and it didn't exit and it just stayed in his neck. And that's where you see the, like his shirt come up and he, and he, right. Right. You know, it gets pushed back and then the bullet tumbled up into his neck basically. Right. And I've seen, I took some screenshots of some frames where it does. I think it could look like a vest or a plate carrier underneath the shirt, but we don't know. Hmm.  Jared Gonzalez. Yeah, can you hear me? Yeah.  Yeah, I can understand, especially given the caliber weapon, why people might be skeptical. But, you know, there's a lot of factors at times that can go into play when a round hits somebody. It's not always the same exact result. Like, there's a lot of, you know, like bullets tumble, for example. So, like, you can get, like, shot in the hip, and it'll exit through, like, your left shoulder or something crazy like that, right? So, like, that's the danger of bullets. Yeah, like, if you really wanted to go down, like, there's plenty of, Uh, at least on Instagram back in the day when I was active duty, I followed a lot of people that did, um, uh, different, like, um, what's like T triple C, like different kinds of like medic, like medical training, like combat courses and stuff like that. And, uh, they would share these images of, you know, like somebody looks like they just got shot in the butt. Right. But it tore through their femurs. or something like that in their legs so route yeah so like bullets that's the real hold on so bullets tumble a lot of times and that's kind of the danger and especially if you consider the fact that he's at a distance right maybe not be the longest distance but he's at a distance 400 feet isn't that what it is  Yeah. Do you want to charge or something like that? Right. Like from home plate to center field is for. Yeah. So it's not that far, but go on. Yeah. But he's aiming downwards and you're like, I don't know. There probably wasn't a lot of wins, but like there are a lot of small factors that really can affect the physics and the impact of a round. Could have bounced off the concrete.  Maybe. I think it's just plausible that it hit his neck. To me, that seems about right. It doesn't seem that out of the ordinary, but I could be wrong. The other thing that some people are pointing out is that, first off, in some of those videos where the guy has a phone gun and he's like this shooting...  Or there's another, like, little what could be a muzzle flash. It's definitely, like, a flash in a window above. So we're definitely in, like, grassy knoll territory. I mean, keep in mind that, like, if the bullet's entering from behind and exiting his neck, then someone in the crowd is going to get hit. So... You know, the other thing is that silencers are not what they are like in movies where it's like. Or something like that, a silencer is going to be very loud shot. And the fact that there's no reaction from anyone around Charlie Kirk also just brings all of those theories into dispute. Well, I mean, a suppressor technically could be really damn quiet, but it gets more sophisticated. You have to use like really specific ammunition. And it's huge, isn't it? It'd be like a big suppressor. I wouldn't say not necessarily. It's in terms of the round, what you call a subsonic round. So that's, you know, going... Oh, so it's not breaking the sound barrier. Exactly. Interesting. Yeah, because even if it has a suppressor on it... You can definitely hear the  Well, someone can speak. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. You can hear that because what you're hearing is the supersonic crack, like breaking the sound barrier essentially. And so that's, that's like really what the, the size of the suppressor does have some play into it, but mostly it has to do with whether you're not using subsonic ammo. Yeah.  I don't know. I'm just going to wait and see on this. It's good to be open-minded. Again, the exit wound theory or the shot from behind theory, I think it does absolutely lend itself to this was a conspiracy by someone, the FBI, Russia, Israel, Erica Kirk herself. um what I was talking about with Lance twigs is is different but yeah I I don't know I I that Valhalla video I just found rather convincing to be honest like in the sense that his thesis was just like this is getting harder to believe we're having to put epicycles on epicycles and it's starting to become implausible  All right, anyone else have anything? Yeah, real quick. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Was it, like, just his entire theory of, like, kind of everything he went through? Or does one of the things kind of, like, have a glaring thing for you? Like, maybe it was, like... Well, I think it's the totality. Yeah, well, it's the totality of it. It's, like, you're... The change, the screwdriver someone pointed out, I do think that that's something that should be addressed. Like he dissembled the gun very quickly and then reassembled it in the woods. Why is this, why would you do that? Why is this happening? The change of clothes, the limp that he's photographed with really does suggest that he had something in his pant leg. Because obviously he's running and jumping off the building later on, so he's carrying something. But then he's not carrying it. It's in a bag now. There's just a lot of changing stories. It's like there's four different shooters. I mean, like, the way I gather for me thus far is like, excuse me, if It's like, I don't feel like we can expect the FBI to like immediately know exactly what happened, really, realistically. I know maybe I'm giving them too much credit, but like if we are going to go the route of, let's say, trusting more or less their point of view here, it's like they're kind of, you know,  developing things and they're trying to figure stuff out. For me, I think what caught me as curious is that if this guy did have this kind of more methodically planned assassination... then why does it somewhat seem just more like spontaneous in the type of actions that he's doing of like going on like discord and doing all these types of like communications it's like and then talking about like him wanting to get away with it right and then we were going over like obviously the rifle and connection to his family it just i don't know how to put it but it seems weird that  that he would have this kind of like long-term trajectory of getting away with it. But then, like I just said, it's like, it does seem more spontaneous if he was the killer, but it's like, yeah, that it's just like, how much time did he have to plan? Like, when was this, when was the Kirk thing announced? When was the soonest he could have heard about it?  Wait, repeat that again? When was the Kirk event announced? Like, when was the soonest that he could hear about it? Because sometimes these things are announced, like, much closer to the time than you would expect. It could have been announced, like, a week earlier. Oh, yeah, I don't know. Anyway. All right, guys. Um...  Let's put a bookmark in it there, and let's get ready for Oh Brother, Where Art Thou on Sunday. Thank you for being here. This was a great show. I love this show, particularly with the interview, but also the discussion afterward. We'll talk to you guys soon. All right. Bye-bye. Have a good weekend. Thanks, guys.

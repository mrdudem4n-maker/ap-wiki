All right. I hope everyone is doing well. Welcome back in. Quick question, convo mode. I noticed you had your hand up even before we started. So there's a bee in your bonnet. Go ahead. Not really. I just have to head out in a second. It's going to take me a minute and 30 seconds or so to go through the question. Would that be all right? Or I don't know how pressed we are for time.  Well, we have a guest tonight, but I guess a minute and a half is not a big deal. All right. Sweet. Yeah, I'll just read it out. I wrote it down. I was recently re-listening to a Bowden lecture on Mishima and had some thoughts on hero worship. It does seem that hero worship is an important aspect of male development, with young men universally idolizing real people like Tom Brady, John Cena, and historically people like King Arthur, Gilgamesh, George Washington, all of whom are masculine and conquering archetypes. However, with the advent of radio and television and now the Internet, virtually every real hero is known to be flawed, leaving only explicitly fictional heroes.  For instance, John Cena and Dwayne The Rock Johnson are on steroids. Stephen Hawking went to the pedophile island. Obama droned babies. Ellen DeGeneres is abusive and rude to staffers. The list goes on and on. But then there are perfect fictional heroes. Ellen DeGeneres is the archetype of the male conquering hero.  Well, I mean, I included a thing for women as well, but just, you know, everyone is flawed. That is in the public spotlight, it seems. Anyway, moving on. But then there are perfect fictional heroes like Superman who are unambiguously good and who generally always oppose, you know, tyranny and conquest due to modern cultural norms. This pulls specifically young men who desire a hero to worship out of reality and towards fiction and virtual worlds, which I think is an interesting phenomenon. In the more favorable eras of our civilization, young men were strongly motivated by hero worship or at least aspirational towards heroic thoughts. This was reinforced by a strong private versus public face with all transgressions from the ideal hidden from the world by a lack of evidence of the transgressions. For instance, Victorian men would offer handkerchiefs to women as a sort of aspirational act towards an idealized gentleman. However, privately, Victorian young men used brothels, which departed from their idealized public face. Here's my question. Sorry about the long preamble. Here's my question. It's a good preamble. There's a lot of food for thought there. So thank you. Thank you. So without hero worship, is it possible for individuals or movements to act heroically, cohesively, progressively? Is this the proverbial tranquilizer of the slumbering Saxon, a lack of real-life, martial, undeniable, conquering idols for young men to aspire to? Clearly, figures from the past like Hitler, Napoleon, Caesar fulfill these characteristics, though each one is now considered taboo. But can figures like this ever emerge again with a digital panopticon always exposing everyone for everything from porn search history to  typing the N-word on Xbox Live and so on. Like, is it possible for there ever to be a very cohesive movement made up of young men who want to change the world? That was the question. Sorry about the long-winded nature. You don't have to apologize because it brings up a lot of very interesting topics. And I do agree more or less with your notion that we're in this never meet your heroes moment.  Just due to the nature of the internet and access and so on. And so we can just learn if someone had an affair, cheated on her taxes. I think that was a big thing in Britain recently. Said something uncouth.  Et cetera, et cetera. And so there is a kind of panopticon of the digital space. I think it's a good way of putting it where you're it is about tearing people down. And they're in some ways even put on a pedestal so they can be knocked off of that. Now, I think the overwhelming issue is that we do live in an end-of-history scenario in which the exploits of the conquering hero are rendered evil at this point.  You can't really idolize Vladimir Putin for killing Ukrainians. I mean, maybe there are some people who say that or some people who think that in private. But even publicly, people who are pro-Russia  will say things like, NATO caused this unfortunate war. So they don't have the courage of their own convictions. They're not willing to just affirm outright conquest, might makes right, badassery. They're not able to just affirm that in itself. They are making excuses for it or putting masks on it.  And I think that is the world we live in. Now, I don't want to sound too much like Girard, because I'm not a Girardian, but...  I think, obviously, Girard is getting at something really true, and he's deeply insightful. We live in a sort of mimetic universe, perhaps. At the very least, we live in a mimetic human society, and I think that this goes for animal society as well. We have instincts to do things. Beavers know that they should build a dam.  deep part of their nervous system that they should build dams. Now, they also learn to build dams as well. Birds have been making nests for thousands upon thousands, perhaps millions of years, in fact. And it is instinctive to a large degree and learned. And so what I'm saying there is that there are instincts to do these cultural things like building a bird's nest or building a dam, but there's also a mimetic quality to it.  They are seeing their parents do it, they're seeing their peers do it, and they're copying it. And definitely with human culture, we've moved beyond instinct in so many ways. We all have... passionate instincts to reproduce and accumulate stuff or wealth, bury some acorns in the ground to fight for status, et cetera. I do think these are fundamentally  instinctive, but we also live in the mimetic sphere. And I don't want to get too much into it, but you want something because someone else wants it. You want to own a Lamborghini because you've seen someone drive one. You want to buy a Rolex because your boss has a Rolex. And so you're copying something. You love it because someone else loves it. You love it because it is loved. And so there's no doubt that the Marshall Aryan conquering archetype was very powerful for young men. You know, they're reading a Burroughs novel or watching a film, perhaps, or just simply being told the story when they're young about greatness. the ability to go into the unknown and carve a new path, to kill the dragon, to take on adversaries. There is something about this where you learn to act that way. And so memes and genes or memetics, copying and pasting, and instincts are reinforced. and so i i do in a in a weird way understand the modern or contemporary or um um a post-modern notion of sort of destroying the heroes so basically you shouldn't imitate this person you shouldn't copy and paste  George Washington, even. And I think I think also like in recent times, we've lived in this world of Marvel heroes. And I think what's interesting about them is that in kind of sickening about them is that they all are good people in a way.  And they might be relatable or flawed, but they're flawed in extremely overly redeemable ways. You know, one might have a hot temper. One might be too charitable or  One might love humanity excessively. That's almost the flaws that these people have, quote unquote flaws. And so you have these superhuman beings that are ultimately trying to maintain the status quo and save the little guy, save the cat from the tree.  et cetera. And I do think it's interesting. I mean, I think you could say that Cape Shet, particularly the Marvel Cinematic Universe,  was a sort of end of heroes type position. You know, they were preventing fascist archetypes or eugenicists like Thanos, et cetera, from doing anything just so you could maintain the status quo, which is assumed to be liberal democracy. And so that was sort of the have your cake and eat it to solution that was reached in the, in the two thousands was basically the Marvel cinematic universe, like the good guy, you know, even Batman, even in the kind of darker DC air area, Batman, you know, it's like, I I'll be hunted because I can take it. He'll almost take on the burdens of being this, uh, violent, conquering badass so that Harvey Dent can present himself as the pure, stainless bureaucrat. So even the DC Marvel dialectic was a kind of Caducean dialectic. It's all about being moral and rescuing liberal democracy.  just some thoughts on this matter. I mean, I think heroes are still out there, but yeah, I think there's something sort of hollow and cheap that we feel in our gut watching a Marvel movie. It might even be very well done and it might have some funny quips and cool action sequences and so on, but it's still at the end of the day that the thing to be imitated is a kind of  quirky, flawed, but redeemable weirdo. I think they were described as weirdos in the first Avengers. Like these weird, you know, I put together a coalition of weirdos to save the world. Those are the types of people to be imitated. And so, yeah, I would say from our perspective, the heroes that are presented by Hollywood at this point are deeply toxic. But I think that's over and it's changing a bit. I mean, wouldn't you just assume if you heard a story of a conquering hero that  This was someone who was deeply flawed. This was someone who might go visit a brothel. This is someone who might kill a civilian or two during his conquest. This is someone who, even when the enemy surrenders, he cuts his head off nevertheless. I think that was maybe not emphasized, but certainly assumed with hero worship of the past. But yeah, it's a very interesting topic. to uh to think about can i can i uh do a rejoinder or or would you like to move on to the interview you can do a rejoinder sure okay yeah so i was an important aspect of this question that i wanted to kind of focus on was the conquest act aspect so if you look back at ancient heroes like kwangdi the you know the yellow emperor that settled china he conquered them and then he made his kingdom and you look at lord indra and he conquered india and then made his  His region, George Washington, he conquered blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's all these people that are full of conquest. They are dominating. They are changing the world and asserting their vision, whereas I can't really think of a hero in the last 100 years. in i don't know that that is somebody that like wants to change the world that was like a media figure that people really like remember james bond i i love james bond i think he's a fascinating myth but he absolutely fits into the paradigm that i just put forward yeah james bond kills the guy who wants to change the world that that is taking place in the books even  The Ian Fleming books, they feel a lot more like Raymond Chandler or...  John le Carré or something. They're grittier, kind of more down to earth. Although there are the gothic and fantastical elements there. But yeah, James, if there's a German businessman who wants to lead us to a new Atlantis under the sea, James Vaughn is going to kill him. If there's a man who wants to engage in a eugenics project, uh while taking us to outer space james bond is going to kill him if if there's a man who's gonna who a former uh mi6 agent alex trevelyan or um silva in skyfall who wants to form a sort of outside intelligence agency that  Usurps the stodgy British one of Democrats and bureaucrats. James Bond is going to kill him. I mean, so James Bond, even though we might like him on some level, he's more like our viewpoint or something. He fits into that paradigm of the the sort of. naive man who saves the world, he saves the status quo from change, as opposed to lionizing Ernst Stavro Blofeld or Hugo Drax or any of these other figures that are genuinely trying to change.  The status quo. Genuinely forging a new path. James Bond is resistant to that. He is bonded to the world as it is. He's a cuck in many ways. He never gets a wife or, well, he sort of does reproduce, sort of gets a wife in both the Fleming novels and the films. But he basically doesn't get to experience the joy of what the villain would experience if he had won. He doesn't get the spoils.  He's unknown, never appreciated. He might, at the end of the day, only get his name chiseled on the wall of the Misex for dying. That's the only reward he gets. Whereas the conquering hero, to the winner go the spoils. And so, yeah, I agree with you. I think this is a long-term sort of post-war project that... history has ended and the the dangerous people are the the kind of outside the the one outside the left-right paradigm you know james bond is more likely to work with a good communist against a fascist than he is to fight the communist i don't i uh there's i don't think he ever really fights the communist in the films  From Russia with Love, the book, he does. That's the Cold War book. All of the other ones, he's fighting a kind of third way. Like you have the status quo of the Cold War. The British Empire is integrated into NATO, et cetera. And there's a third way someone trying to break apart the stability. And James Bond kills him.  In the movies, that's always the case. If he's fighting a Soviet, it's like a rogue Soviet agent or something.  there's never going to be a real victory. There's going to be kind of a reset, a return home. And so this is a long-term thing. You can see this cropping up, you know, in the 1950s with Ian Fleming. Absolutely in the 2010s with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And I don't know if there's... I don't know... I don't know if it's possible for us to imagine another type of hero, although I do think there's a desire in Hollywood, apparently, and a desire among the moviegoing public, apparently, to look at these things in the past. So the Napoleon movie, I don't know really how successful or relevant that was, but it  It was somewhat relevant. They're making a Hannibal movie, which is interesting with Denzel Washington. I heard about that a while ago. There's gladiator to came out and so on. So maybe we can only glimpse that type of figure in the far off distant past where, you know, we're isolated from his exploits. Real quick, I'm trying to think of examples of characters that asserted their will, changing the world, doing something related to conquest in literature. Anyone in the comments or whatever can list them so I can look into them because I can't think of any media ever in the last hundred years where it's like, I want to change the world. Today, I think I will go out and change the world, and this person is portrayed as a hero or someone that you empathize with. Maybe like... in the realm of technology, like movies like The Social Network or something about Mark Zuckerberg.  You know, he was sort of a bit of an anti-hero, but sort of the hero. You were ultimately invited to empathize with him, just running roughshod over the Winklevoss twins and creating this amazing new technology called Facebook that we now all hate. That's one that just sort of comes to mind, where the renegade third-way new force...  is lionized to some degree. I might be missing one, but again, that's all in the realm of Silicon Valley and no one dies in a way. The world doesn't really change. So it's not, you know, it's different. Thank you so much for entertaining my question. Thank you very much. Yeah. Okay. I know that we do have our guest here. I just saw him pop up in the participants, but AA, real quick.  Yes. Hi, Richard. Can you hear me? Hey, yes. Okay. So just wanted to piggyback off what the previous person was saying. I remember reading the book by Samuel Franz's Beautiful Losers.  And it was interesting because it reminded me of the Lost Cause myth with the Civil War. And it reminded me also of the American right in general, or even the right globally, and their addiction to siding with the losing team constantly. whether it be Hitler or it be, um, the old South, the old South, just lost causes or in social things, gay marriage, uh, civil rights. They lost that battle. And I think there's something demoralizing about the rights addiction to hear. They're not heroes. They're losers. And, um,  We should, I don't think we should valorize people who lose. Now, there's something to be said for liberal pussification or whatever, then that's the fair criticism, but liberals have been winning. And I think that as Apollonians, we should sort of take that  cause up. There's this tendency in the dissident right, and you've talked about it with Jared Taylor and others, of just constantly apologizing for their cause. We're not racist. We just want white people to have a homeland. We don't hate blacks. We just love our own people. Taking our own side and  And white people, we actually, as opposed to blacks, we actually don't commit crimes. Right. Exactly. Is that really... We couldn't possibly break the rules. It's not in us. It's not in our nature. All those white serial killers are probably an eighth Jewish or something. Right. It's just Hitler is interesting because he was evil. Right.  Hitler is interesting because he did the Holocaust. If he didn't do it, he'd just be another dictator. Yeah, he'd be another 10-pot dictator. He invaded, literally, both sides of the post-war status quo. Now, obviously, that's looking at it retroactively. Looking at it from our perspective, we see the stability post-1945. Right.  But isn't it interesting that he invaded both of those things? Like, he was trying to destroy both. And I do think for the Bond villain, I've heard other people, I won't name names here, who are sort of white nationalist types or whatever, and they'll talk about...  The Aaron Stavro Blofeld. Oh, that name sounds so Jewish. You know, Bond is just it's like Bond killing George Soros or something is what they imagine. It's not what I see in the books. I love James Bond, but if anyone's Jewish, it might be James Bond, to be honest. The Dionysian figure holding the martini, constantly drunk. sent out like a missile from the establishment uh James I I don't know how much we want to I mean Ian Fleming said that he uh took the name James Bond from a bird watching book that he was using in Jamaica it was a bird watching book by James Bond he said oh it's it's flat monosyllabic do we have to necessarily take his word for that might he be lying in a way he is 007  The first villain he faces is Le Chiffre, the cipher. And James Bond is almost this mirror of the cipher, the double O. While he is an agent of the Soviet Union operating brothels in France, James Bond is a kind of agent of NATO, explicitly in the book Casino Royale, engaging in... fornication on behalf of the west and they're kind of mirror images of one another in many ways even their personalities are very different and um i don't know it's fascinating 007 as a i mean is there jim going on in ian fleming is james bond actually implied to be a jewish figure  I'm sort of willing to go there. I'm not positive. I would have to really do a serious review of it. Mark and I have actually talked about this.  Mark is not the fan of James Bond that I am. So none of this has been written down in the book. I'm sort of not exactly spitballing. I'm kind of showing how I think about these things. But either whether it was unconscious or conscious, I think that is the better figure. In the books, Thunderball, it is clearly indicated that Aaron Stavroff-Bullfeld is not Jewish. Now, Le Chiffre is Jewish or suggested to be Jewish in the book. he might be Jewish is that they have a dossier on him uh but the big bad and Hugo Drax is a former Nazi who's trying to seek revenge on Britain trying to create a third way I I think all of the big Vaughn villains are to some degree Hitler avatars and that that is because from the standpoint of the James Bond universe which is a Cold War universe  Hitler was the one who invaded them both. Hitler is the one who would disrupt that stability that was established. And so I think he is, in fact, the avatar of every James Bond villain.  And sometimes it's on the nose, sometimes a little more subtle, but it's always there. And I think it's probably more accurate to suggest that, you know, James Bond and his curious background, parents dying in a climbing accident. And who is he really, an orphan? There's a lot of indications that he might be subtly Jewish. Just saying. How is that for you? yeah i tend to agree yeah um but i mean i guess my point was that the american right is the last place you want to look for heroes or anyone that they worship or lionize because they're all very demoralizing characters and i don't just mean their policies i just mean the rhetoric the way they talk they're just losers yes  Fighting the last war. Yes. Jokul, deep left. I am... Well, I'm a little bit sorry for...  delaying just slightly on introducing you and welcoming you here. But this is a very interesting discussion. So I'm not that sorry. I hope you enjoyed it. Do you have anything to contribute to the hero question or the kind of left, right, and third way question?  Well, first of all, let me make sure my audio is working. Can you hear me? Sounds great, actually. Okay, excellent. So I'm listening to this exegesis of James Bond, and I never thought I would hear it. We're finally tearing down...  What I thought was like the last hope of Western civilization was James Bond. And now it's like, nope, he's actually Jewish. He's a Jew. We can't even have that. But I like it. I mean, I like that kind of very thorough...  I mean, I might even call it from a normal person's perspective, perverse. Like you're taking something, you're turning it on its head, you're turning the body inside out, you're going through this, you know, it's kind of like I think of Odin with the giants and he's sort of taking apart the brains and the guts and he's like forming the earth with it. So yeah, that kind of dissection, that kind of analysis, just on an emotional level, is appealing um and i yeah it is it is interesting the the dynamic of is so when you said like he's always fighting hitler um because these people are always trying to find a third way i mean the first thing that popped into my head was like a duganism And maybe to kind of foreshadow, if we get into the Epstein stuff, it's like, I think that's the way that Likud and Netanyahu present themselves to the world, is we are ethno-nationalists, we are Duganists, we are Eurasianists, we are third positionists.  And we don't need to have a unipolar moment. We don't need to have a global new world order of NATO. We can have all these separate civilizations that are sovereign, that are independent, and we can have nationalism for all peoples. And that's a workable, peaceful order. And what's actually terrifying and violent is this nato force that is everywhere you know and and so that's kind of how i think of james bond is that you know he's in indonesia and he's in south africa and he's in peru i mean he is just this omnipresent specter and there is there are there is a religious quality to that the way in which he manifests at anywhere at any time i mean the greek gods did that um  He takes on various forms. He takes on disguises. He's clever. He uses the the Trojan horse to to get into sticky situations where he doesn't belong. And then he pops out and then he kills the bad guy. And so, yeah, you can you know, there's this when you read and I know you guys look at the Iliad as as from a critical perspective, not just like, oh, you know, this is 100 percent good because it's old. But yeah, there is what I would call sedimentarism, meaning that you have these different moral systems. You can call them Apollonian and Jewish, or you can give them different names. But there are these conflicting moral systems that then are syncretized in these paradoxical ways that form pantheons. So you'll have the god of hunting, and you'll have the god of agriculture. The reason why they're together in a pantheon is because you had to smash two societies together when one invaded the other, but wasn't able to completely exterminate the other for basically economic reasons. You needed farming. So you maintain those gods, but you put them in a kind of family situation. You marry them together. And every time you do that, every time there's a new invasion, and I think there were historical waves of invasions that when you look at the parallels between Heracles and Perseus and these Greek heroes with their flying horses and their slaying dragons, they're doing the same thing over and over again. It's very redundant. And if it was a pure union, collective unconscious, it's all symbolic of the inner workings of the psyche, you wouldn't expect that kind of redundancy. uh you know same thing when you read the old testament if you take the old testament as oh it's all kabbalah it's all numerology and it all has meaning well no maybe it's actually just history maybe this is the only way that people could preserve history was by sacralizing it and so in that case we should look at heracles as the personification of a particular tribe um that you know was maybe part of a step culture a wider step culture  But, uh, uh, Perseus is a separate tribal expansion or wave that flowed into Greece. So you get that sediment terrorism where it's like a sedimentary formation of rock. You can see the layers where, you know, you get these cycles and they get fold over and fold over sort of like forming the samurai steel. Uh, you just keep folding it over and it creates this very robust, uh, echoing effect memetically that, you know, you just keep seeing the same rise and fall and rise and fall. And, you know, over time that, you know, just kind of allows for this fractal equality where then we can take those mythic structures and then we can create fiction. And now you even have AI. So we can generate trillions of books in in an instant and it would take us trillions of years to i mean not literally maybe trillions of years but it would take an inordinate amount of time to read all the fiction that ai could produce and that theoretically you know you could enjoy as as some slop um and i'm sure there are people you know right now doing that they're talking to their fictional chatbot so there's this fractalic quality to that um and the only way that you may be you know when you talk about the return of heroes i think that it's um it's kind of the reduction of that fractalic irony of everything is double-edged and everything is perverse and everything it's like no there's a forward facing arrow it cannot be turned around you can't look under you know it is a vector of force  It's not an object that you can it's pure will. And so you can't actually manipulate it and invert it. It can't be manhandled because it's just pure energy. So that that kind of. vitality um you know i think it does i mean that i my interpretation of nietzsche is that you know you actually want the last man because the only way you can get the uber manches through the last man so you know to this point about like oh well we have to uh save the cat out of the tree you know we have to keep everything copacetic  You're kind of delaying the inevitable. You're stretching out the pulling off of the Band-Aid rather than just ripping it off. And then it's like, okay, we got to the last one. We've gotten to the utter depravity and it's over. And only then can something new happen. emerge from that like ultimate and I think even Christianity has this concept of the Antichrist comes and everything is totally depraved and it's only at that moment when all hope is lost that you get and of course in Norse paganism as well after Ragnarok then you get this rebirth so you know I think there you know whether that's like a metaphysical truth or whether that's we've been so culturally conditioned over thousands of years to believe it has to be that way that we've created a self-fulfilling prophecy  You know, I don't know. Well, isn't Duganism? He had a webzine called Kation. And it's the concept as well is fighting against the devil or fighting against the Antichrist as a sort of last refuge. And I think the power of Nietzsche, as you said, is there's no way out but through that.  Nietzsche might be a conservative in certain respects, but he's not a conservative. He's a conservative superficially, if that. And you need to pass through full-on decadence. You need the last man. The last man is going to create a herd society that can be ruled by the Ubermensch.  And so it's one step in a longer process. You don't want to prop up Christianity of like, well, oh my God, they wouldn't have anything to believe in. Look at these beautiful churches. Do you really want to criticize this? That's the attitude of a conservative. Nietzsche is like, let's face it. Let's just...  pull the bandaid off. Let's take a shot of tequila as opposed to sipping a beer or wine or something. Let's just go right in there and see what happens and risk it. And I do think that that  It's obviously reckless in some ways, and I can see why people don't like that. But that is pursuing truth at all costs. That is facing your fears. That is accepting your destiny and moving forward. And the liberal hero is someone, or even in this case, the Duganian hero of fighting off the decadence. And we just need to hold on to our traditions just a little bit longer here in Russia or whatever. It is weak. And it's refusing to address the real issue. It's pretending that you can kind of inch backwards a little bit and not be taken into the decadence itself because the decadence is overwhelming. What do they fear? They fear the unipolar moment. This is the thing. I even saw today, Konstantin von Hofmeister left Arctos or got kicked out. Who knows? I don't care. I've been fired before too. It's not a big deal. But for basically just being too, duganist uh but what do they fear they fear the unipolar world they embrace multi-polarity which is  basically what they don't like is the overwhelming, compelling nature of liberalism. And I get it. Like a lot of people don't like the gay pride rallies. I get it. People don't like the redneck patriotism of America. That is true. But I think it's more important to look at the degree to which Americanism, the unipolarity, liberalism, whatever you want to call this thing is fundamentally irresistible. Everyone on Earth basically wants to have an Instagram profile, wants to go on vacation at the White Lotus, wants to have sex with hot chicks or handsome men, wants to have a job where they can buy a cool car and feel like they're a master of the universe.  And they want to have that maybe mediated by kind of national patriotism and et cetera. But I don't think we should overlook the idea of how powerful this end of history force is. It is this, you know, like give liberals their due.  Give Fukuyama his due. People like to bash these people or think that everyone hates America now, etc. No, Fukuyama was accurately describing the just overwhelming power of the liberal idea.  And he was right. And I don't think there is a competing notion because even the Muslims want this too. Even the Muslims, they might have a wife in a burqa. They're also wearing a Rolex and driving a Lambo and talking to their friends about how they're getting paid 2 million and they bought Bitcoin this year or whatever. Even they are totally embedded in this.  A place like Dubai is just that expression of it. You have some reactionary elements. It is fundamentally liberalism with reactionary characteristics. It's Las Vegas and Mecca rolled into one. And it's like you need to give the devil his due, so to speak. You need to recognize just how powerful this force has been and how even now there is no real competing force. Yeah, I mean, the Arab world is just kind of goofy because there's all of this pomp and circumstance about how, you know, there's a billion Muslims and they're going to rise up and they're going to take over Europe. And this is another problem I have with the Lukud narrative is this idea of, you know, Islamofascism and it's a real competitor to liberalism. And this is the clash, Toynbee's clash of civilizations. And it's like, No, I mean, we have data on what Muslims are like in their countries and when they come to the West. And we know what they do. There are these, I call it hysterical nihilism, is when you realize that the floor of your religion has fallen out from under you. And so you just start doing a death spasm. And so every time one of these migrants... does one of these horrible attacks, whether it's one of these, maybe the gang rapes are in a different category, but the stabbings and the- Christmas market. Yeah, they're driving in a car at a crowd of people. That is, and you could say like, well, it's mental illness or it's schizophrenia, but it's clearly like there is some- not just political force, it's a religious force that's driving these people, but it's not a powerful, vitalistic, confident religious force. It is a fearful, it is an animal backed into a corner that sees it's come into this belly of the beast of the West. And it understands, you know, these people are thinking like animals and they understand that what they are surrounded by is just so much more powerful than they are.  And so all they're doing is, yeah, lashing out like a cornered animal or something. And it's pathetic. And, you know, people die. But at the end of the day, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, wild tiger ran out of the jungle and bit somebody, you know, and somebody died. And it's like, that's all they have. They don't have, you know, a cohesive vision of, oh, we're going to unite the Uma together. And like Scott Ritter is writing this fan fiction about how oh, you know, Israel better not do this and that because Turkey is going to unite with Iran and Saudi Arabia, they're going to, you know, reform the caliphate. And, you know, it's like, you know, Turkey's in is in NATO. And I mean, we've we've seen what I actually I feel ashamed that I even gave Iran the stock that I gave them, you know, two years ago or whatever. And we've seen where that's gone. I think people I mean, as an aside, it's like People, I think, sometimes imagine that Iran, because they have a cumulative view of history, so it's like, well, Iran was great in the past, and so it's great today. I think they underestimate how much brain drain has occurred because of the religious theocracy. I mean, I know a lot of very intelligent Iranians in the West, you know, the country. Yeah. So it's not that Iranians aren't smart, but that their country has been really, I mean, the greatest sanction of all is not the economic sanctions, but it's the human capital sanction of sucking all of those people out of the country. And what you're left with is like a very thin sliver that maybe maintains the military, but then, you know, can they even do that? Have they even done that? So. um yeah just just to say whether it's the sunnis or the shiites because sometimes people think oh well the sunnis are bad but the shiites are you know they're the competent ones it's really bad all across the board um and so really the the only people you would point to and say well maybe there is some alternative is is the chinese but to your you know example of las vegas it's like all these chinese cities are like you know kids light up toys now it's like all the skyscrapers are like these colorful christmas trees and and people point at that and they say wow china's an advanced civilization because they can light up you know with leds that are a skyscraper and that that's i've been to fcot center too that that's also an advanced civilization but yeah it's yeah yeah yeah it's like that globe in las vegas and and and i i do understand there too that's awesome  Yeah, there's like a childish wonder and excitement that comes with those things. And I'm not saying that I'm not... I don't look out the plane window and say, oh, that's really cool. But there is a limitation to that. I mean, I've... been a consistent fan of peter zion even though you know he he has a lot of credit i mean i feel like he and i are kindred spirits in the fact that we talk a lot of shit we get things wrong but we say things that are you know pushing the conversation forward and forcefully and kind of taking those risks of making big claims and you know what if it turns out china doesn't collapse by you know whatever he said it was 2030 it's like he looks foolish but to at least put forward the thought experiment if actually this country has some real big systematic problems yeah and they're spamming you know apartment buildings for a declining population they're building new housing for a declining population it's not like america where you know detroit gets bombed out so now now we have to build a bunch of suburbs they don't have that problem So, you know, there's like there's a Keynesian economy around black crime that people, you know, it's like people make a lot of money off of that. China doesn't have that problem. They don't have the inner city decay or whatever. And so there's no reason to be building, you know, hundreds of new apartment buildings and hundreds of new rail lines and high speed rail, you know, because the population is declining. So you're just spamming infrastructure.  You know, I maybe China will change that around. Maybe, you know, it's it's it's difficult to I don't want to I don't want to say with certainty that I know China is going to collapse. But that's the thing is I would look at is just dismiss the Muslims and look at the Chinese and be like, you know, if anyone was going to have an alternative, it would be them. But, you know, I'm skeptical of that, too.  I'm extremely skeptical as well. And I don't know if they can really create a world paradigm beyond the Chimerica relationship, which has changed, you know, the past 30 years, but it still is what it is. And I don't think they are offering a compelling vision that everyone wants and a world paradigm to compete with Americanism. and perhaps i'm blind to it but i don't see it yeah i mean look at what they do in africa is they hire russian troops to go around and to to bully the french and the french are you know too pussy to do anything about it and uh and you know i've actually at some point speculated that if the war does end the special ops in ukraine aren't just gonna retire they're going to africa and they're gonna continue the fight against the russians in africa but the french won't do it i mean that's uh  It's kind of like a farce of what's going on, but that's what the Chinese do. They refuse to put Chinese troops in Africa. Even when you get some tin pot dictator who seizes these Chinese infrastructure, say, oh, we're not paying the Chinese. The Chinese just, you know, they just go home.  They just say, oh, well, we'll write it off as an insurance loss or whatever. We know Africa, the Africans, they do this all the time. I'd be interested to look at the numbers, but I think it's conceivable that the Chinese infrastructure project in Africa is operating at a loss. And the reason why is it's a jobs program.  for the Chinese to go out because they have this constant need to grow their economy. And the only way you do that is you produce more. Well, Chinese people don't need more infrastructure. You know who does? Africans. And so they're sending all these Chinese engineers out to Africa to build all these big public works projects that, you know, maybe they're going to make money on it. Or maybe the Africans will just say like...  Okay, we're not going to pay you. You and what army? You know, it's the same problem that the Allies had with Russia when they became Bolsheviks. So they said, hey, you owe all these loans. We gave you these loans during World War I. The Bolsheviks said, we don't have to pay those. What are you going to do? Invade us? And they actually tried. They tried to invade Russia and they failed in like 1919, you know, the expeditionary force in Archangels.  But that is a phenomenon going on in Russia, or excuse me, that's going on in Africa. The Chinese just refuse to be forceful. They refuse to be confident. This is a country of over, it's like 1.4 billion people, supposedly the largest army in the face of the planet.  And they can't even defend their companies being seized and nationalized. It's just like, I mean, you could literally go in with like 500 guys and some helicopters and just strafe these people. I mean, that's what the Israelis did to the Arabs. They just took out the Air Force and they just bombed the hell out of them. That's what they're doing with Hamas. They're just sitting ducks. There's no reason the Chinese couldn't do that, but they were afraid.  They're afraid to upset even the Africans to be seen as the bullies. Whereas the West, I mean, we're supporting this genocide in Palestine. And it's like, well, we can do that. We can afford to make those kind of tragic missteps. We can afford an Iraq war. We can afford an Afghanistan. The Chinese can't even afford to defend their companies in Niger. And so whenever somebody says, oh, no, well,  They have all this, all these tanks on paper. They have all these weaponry on paper. It's like, but it's psychologically, they're so fearful to project force. They even put the ideology aside of, you know, let's imagine a world in which, you know, really, I don't know, libertarian theories or Duganist theories, whatever, where  We don't need global liberalism anymore. Trade can occur just through mutual benefit and whatever. We don't need these ideological structures. I'm really skeptical of that. But even just in the material terms, they're unwilling to do that. So that's just more... more cynicism about China, although I wouldn't really want to live in a Chinese dominated world anyway. So maybe it's I wouldn't either. Yeah, that is I totally agree. I think we're kind of kindred spirits on this one as well. But the reason I had you on was not Fukuyama and China and Russia and Africa, but Jeffrey Epstein. And OK, so let me let me set this up.  And I'll, in a way, I'll be the devil and the devil's advocate. I'll sort of set up something for you to slam, basically. Okay, so Robert Maxwell, notorious, though highly successful media mogul, stole half a billion dollars from the media company he ran poor pensioners were left high and dry not only that he was clearly a spy for israel and he was after his mysterious death on a yacht he was celebrated as in effect a war hero his daughter his beloved daughter, the one child that he unquestionably loves and sees as a continuation of himself. I always mispronounce it. Ghislaine or Ghislaine? Ghislaine. Ghislaine? Ghislaine. Doesn't matter. She continues his work and she meets up with Jeffrey Epstein, another mysterious Jew, doesn't have a college degree, was hired on as a math teacher for reasons that are inexplicable, was given power of attorney by Leslie Wexner of Victoria's Secret fame, a lingerie billionaire, and proceeds to create the greatest Israeli-backed blackmail operation in world history. He flies in all of these folks, Trump,  the wheelchair science guy, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, everyone, he flies in there. Why? To videotape them having sex with minors, to have blackmail, so that any time they... And anytime any sort of decision about Israel is up for a vote, they can hold this Damocletian sword over their head of, do you really want your wife and kids and the media at large to see those videos that we have of you today?  do what is in what's good for the Jews, what's in Israel's interest. And Trump was a part of this. Trump is no doubt compromised deeply by this. And it has fallen apart. Ghislaine has gone to prison for sex trafficking and some sort of conspiracy. Jeffrey Epstein, we don't know how he died, but he's...  He's gone from the world. So the whole system, the conspiracy has fallen apart. But we need to investigate this. And we need to know what sort of espionage ring was taking place during the Epstein trial. Now, I would say, before I let you go here, I would say that I was exaggerating slightly, but I largely myself agree with this argument.  viewpoint. To broad strokes, I agree with what was just said. But you have put forward a great article in your Substack that offers a compelling different view on this. So the floor is yours. So the first point I would make is that in 2019, Yair Netanyahu started posting about Jeffrey Epstein and saying, we got to investigate this guy. Look at his ties to Ehud Barak. Now, most people, and I think if I'm speaking to an audience of people who are fed up with Israel and they're fed up with the Jews, as a monolith, bringing up these internal divisions of why would Yair Netanyahu hate Jeffrey Epstein? Why would he hate Ehud Barak? I thought all the Jews were on the same team. And I'm going to throw out a metaphor to kind of maybe help massage people's brains, because I think, yeah, when we talk about Jews...  It's always like this exceptional people that's like divine or satanic. And there's no parallel for their behavior across space and time. You know, it's almost like a nominalist conception of all the goyim are like animals and they behave like automaton. But the Jews are like these, you know, almost, you know, Nietzschean or nominalist figures. And they can just act outside of rationality. You know, anti-Semitism is the world's oldest hatred has no rational explanation, you know, so they exist outside of space and time. And what I'm going to create as a parallel is that from 1933 to 1939 in Britain, there were two distinct sides. They weren't of equal power, but there were two distinct sides. And one side said, you know, we hate the communists. We hate the Russians. We traditionally have had a naval competition with France, and now we have a huge naval competition with America. and so ideally we need to knock out the communists we need to contain or neutralize the french and then we need to focus on competing with america and if you want to accomplish those three goals germany is a great ally because they can smash the russians they can counterbalance the french to keep them from competing with you in africa and then you can focus your entire military your entire navy is just competing with america preventing them from taking over the world And that was really the only plan that the British Empire had to survive as something independent from America, not in a NATO structure. And then there was the other idea, which was that, well, you know, Winston Churchill, I think he was even born in America. You know, FDR, it's like all these people are wasps in America. They're wasps in Britain.  London and New York are part of the same. It's a dyad. It's a financial system that stretches across the Atlantic, and that is the wealth of the British Empire. It's not in the military per se. I mean, you could say fundamentally it's always a question of the military, but that financial system has... has to be protected and and its future is wedded to america there's no way to disentangle london from new york and that financial system survives and hitler said exactly that he didn't say that the jews started world war ii and now you may think that he he didn't say that because he was being polite you know he didn't want to seem like a boorish low-class anti-semite by blaming the jews but if you actually take him at his word  What he says, it's the plutocratic international finance that has started this war. That was his belief. And I think the reason why he said that is because he looked at these two factions in Britain. One of them was basically anti-American, anti-French, anti-Russian. And as a result, pro-German, Houston, Stuart, Chamberlain.  Oswald Mosley and there were many others besides those weren't even fascists. They were there were Tories, even people in the Labor Party didn't want to go to war with Germany. So there was a huge diversity of thought of people who did not want to go to war with Germany just said, you know, let Germany cook, let them take out the communists, let them contain the French will focus on the Americans.  There's an internal logic to that, even if I disagree with it. And Hitler said that the reason why the British didn't take that path is because of this international finance, because of this stock market, this international market between London and New York. And of course, Jews were disproportionately a part of that as they had been for hundreds of years and so on. So that story of how Britain as a nation with a leadership class, with a distinct elite, with an ethnic identity, it could be so thoroughly ideologically divided that to imagine that alternative history in which a Mosley or the labor faction or whoever, they're able, and by the way, it wasn't even Winston Churchill, it was Neville Chamberlain. People give Churchill too much credit. He didn't start the war. The British elite decided to start the war, the king decided to start the war, but there's an alternative history which none of that happens in Britain is a completely different state today. It's economically different, it's demographically different, it's financially different, it has a totally different relationship with Europe.  And the entire world is transformed as a result. And so when people look at Jewish factionalism and they say, well, you know, at the end of the day, it's all it's all Jewish, you know, and and that's and it's either in the Christian evangelical view, everything that's Jewish is good. Everything it's the Midas touch, everything the Jews touch is good. And so if the Jews spit on Christians, well, that's a blessing.  And if the Jews, you know, genocide the Palestinians, well, you know, that's a blessing. So everything that the Jews do is a blessing. Or, you know, the alternative view is that Jews are absolutely depraved and corrupted and they can't do anything good. They can just do different forms of evil. So it's just, you know, Coke versus Pepsi. They're just two evils fighting. And why should we favor one over the other? Well, I just think that's an oversimplification, and I'm obviously biased in this respect, but I just don't hold that view. I think that if you want this kind of stable international order... than having a increasingly genocidal state that is, you know, using this lobby to basically use America not just as a financial shield or literally the Iron Dome, a military shield, but also a PR shield, a moral shield. And so anytime someone attacks Israel... America is kind of like, you know, literally surrounding Israel and saying it happens in the United Nations. We always veto all these measures. Right. So we're always there as the big brother to say, you know, you know, to mess with Israel, you're gonna have to go through me first. And there's a real geopolitical cost to that. Now. trying to quantify that is difficult i mean it's it's very abstract i mean you can look at opinion polling you can say well within america americans are less trusting of the government and some of that has to do with the actions of israel and our relationship with israel um abroad if you pull these other countries and you ask citizens in other countries you know what do you think about america israel is going to come up in that conversation it's going to be a negative thing so if we want america to be you know as you mentioned it's this shining city on a hill everyone looks up to it everyone wants to be american whether you're muslim or chinese or african or russian even you know look at sigma boy the newest russian hit song i mean if that's not american culture i don't know it is unfortunately  But this is the global structure. And if you're eroding the confidence in that, in the trust in institutions, international institutions, what strength does international law have if Israel daily violates it with settlements?  with starvation tactics. If they violate the Geneva Conventions each and every day and no one does anything about it, eventually those rules stop existing. You trample laws too many times and they stop existing. So there's a moral hazard. And there was an alternative. So Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995.  And he was assassinated by a guy who was groomed by Shabak. Now, there's two potential conspiracy theories, or probably more, but I'll say the two main conspiracy theories are that basically Shabak wanted to create a kind of Reichstag fire event. They wanted this... crazy lunatic fringe you know wacko to at least attempt to kill the prime minister and then to use that as an excuse to clamp down on the religious zealots on the religious right to actually attack Likud um and it sort of went horribly wrong because I mean Benjamin Netanyahu was elected the next year right so that if that was Sharon I think yeah  Well, I think it was Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996, right? And there may be an intermediary. So I think when Rabin died, he was immediately replaced by Sharon. But within the next year, obviously, I'm saying if that was the plan, a kind of Reichstag fire, then it clearly didn't go according to plan, right? But the alternative view is that within Shabak, there were elements...  who knew this guy was going to kill the prime minister. They helped him kill the prime minister. And then when he was killed, it was sort of a wake up call. And Shabak had sort of new leadership and they tried to kind of do an investigation. But the damage was already done. So, you know, in either case, Shabak knew  Someone was planning to kill the president. It's kind of like, you know, we had that weird Trump assassination where the guy's on the roof and the snipers are like trained on the guy and they're like watching him shoot into the crowd, watching him shoot. And after he gets off a few rounds, then they kill him. It's almost like and I'm those sort of things like the Las Vegas shooting, those sort of conspiracies, they're totally opaque to me. So I don't even have an opinion either way. I mean, it's I just don't have enough information to even make a guess as to what was going on. But in this case, It's very clear we can see the assassination of this prime minister really destroyed the Israeli left. It really demoralized the Israeli left. Because Netanyahu, you have to understand that just before the assassination, he was in the streets leading protests where they would take effigies of Rabin. With his face printed out, you know, some Xerox copy of his face on like a scarecrow hanging from the gallows. You know, so they were calling for this man's death because he wanted a Palestinian state. He wanted to move that process, the two state solution forward. And so they were calling for bloody murder. And when they got what they wanted, they were elated. And the guys who in Shabak, who allowed it to happen, got off scot-free. They were not prosecuted. They were granted immunity. So it's a it was a hugely if you were on the left, you were like, you know, OK, it's it's kind of over like they won. They killed our prime minister and they can just do whatever they want. And they're getting elected. I mean, in a similar way, I think a lot of leftists were supremely demoralized, you know, in 2024.  It's like there was no Antifa uprising. There was no it was just like, OK, I guess it's over. I guess fascism won. I guess we're all going to die now. I mean, you would talk to leftists. I literally would talk to leftists who would say like, yeah, I'm feeling a lot more suicidal than normal. You know, I think I might add, you know, and probably there were people who killed themselves because of that. Right. So it's a very low moment. And since that point, the left is not rebounded. They have not been able to recover from that. Now, there was an opportunity.  In 2019, where there was an attempt by the Israeli left to say, you know what? Netanyahu is so corrupt. He's under investigation. Judicial reform is out of control. We need to unite as the left. Ehud Barak was the man. He was the hero of the left to take back power from Likud.  And what does Netanyahu do? He says, oh, no, no, no, don't investigate my corruption. You need to investigate Ehud Barak's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, because Jeffrey Epstein gave him three million dollars. Now, I want to reiterate this point when we say things like Epstein was an agent of Israel. you're making out Israel to be a united force when you should be thinking of, okay, we've got Oswald Mosley versus Winston Churchill, or we've got, you know, within Germany, you had Hindenburg, and then you had Hitler, or von Papen and Hitler, right? So there's a divided government, and I call it the secret civil war, from the assassination of Robert Maxwell to the takeover by Netanyahu of Likud, I call it the secret civil war because, yeah, Robert Maxwell, one of the richest, most powerful media moguls of all time, killed, I mean, supposedly accident, right? But clearly he was in a lot of trouble. I mean, you could even make the argument that he committed suicide because he knew he was going to be killed. I've heard that as well. He had a good long life and might as well just go out. And he was also trying to, I think, protect his family and protect his daughter because I think they were threatening. And I think that's part of why Ghislaine has been such a dedicated activist in her life in trying to fight. Basically, you know, think about it like this. In World War Two, the British had a plan that if the Germans successfully invaded, they would evacuate the government to Canada.  And they would continue the war from Canada. And I think that's how Ghislaine viewed Israel. She said, you know what? Israel was started as a cooperative agreement between the West and the Jews. Anglo-Zionism, we're going to work together. It's international. We're going to have a rules-based order. All of these things. And then Netanyahu comes along.  With like third worldism, just we're killing the prime minister. We can't we don't debate. We don't vote. We just we're just assassinating people. It was a coup essentially to take over the government. She said this state is being destroyed. These people are aligned with the Herodim. And by the way, on this issue, and I know we'll get into the victim, the so-called victims who, you know, they say Virginia Gouffray, who is now dead,  And I believe she was a narcissist like Jeffrey Epstein was a narcissist. I mean, these people are all narcissists. But, you know, people kill themselves very oftentimes are narcissists. It is a way of getting attention, you know. So so although, you know, you may say, OK, well, she killed himself. Don't speak ill of the dead. I mean, that's part of a pattern of behavior of her whole life.  is her identity centered around her victimhood and her pain and so on. And I don't, you know, I would be a little less quick to valorize that because she said a lot of things that were false. And she specifically these, you know, I think it was Ann Farmer, you know, it's in the article where they say like, you know, Epstein was a lizard. He was a shapeshifter. He was a demon, you know, did all these things.  And these claims are exactly parallel QAnon and Pizzagate. And all of these claims came, you know, if you look at the Israeli bot networks and how they influence our elections, how they influence our social media, it's very clear that all of this was propped up to hurt the Clintons.  And Clinton, you go back to 1996, fought against Netanyahu. He tried to help the opposition. He basically campaigned for the left in Israel. And Netanyahu never forgave that. And he said, you know what, I'm going to destroy the Clinton legacy.  And again, there's just so many reasons that it's pertinent. It's important to not just say, well, Israel is a monolithic entity where all the Jews are on one side and they all hate us and they all think we're Goyim. Ghislaine Maxwell's mother is a blue-eyed or was a blue-eyed Huguenot. Noble royalty, you know it's like this idea that all Jews believe that the goyim are untouchable and they don't have souls it's like that was her mother, you know she was not a Jewish supremacist these claims that you know she she just hated the goyim and she wanted them all the it's just not true.  But there are people who do believe that. The Haredi in Israel, they don't want to shake hands with Goyim. They really do think they're unclean. They really do think that if you mix together, there's something unclean about that. And so the fact that Netanyahu has allied with that 13% of that population, that they are the keystone of his coalition. He couldn't survive without them. He's dependent on them.  So he basically has to give them whatever they want. They get more welfare so they can pump out more babies so they can have more votes so they can get, you know, it's just like this endless parasitism, except, you know, in America, we have welfare issues with blacks or Hispanics or something. But the blacks and Hispanics are not actually really not plotting to take over the government. But these Haredi really do want to make Israel into a theocracy. And what happened? You know, we talk all the time about, oh, Iran is a crazy. The Moas have these nuclear weapons. What happens when Haredi?  Who think that all the goyim are unclean, are in possession of nuclear weapons? I mean, that's a scary thought, right? So I oppose that kind of religious fundamentalism and that kind of theocratic thinking. I wouldn't want, you know, Christian evangelical fundamentalists in charge of nukes. I wouldn't want Muslim extremists.  And I don't want the Heredia in charge of that. And I think that's a legitimate point of concern that if you just say, oh, well, Israel, they just don't want to kill us. It's the Samson option. You know, it's this one dimensional perspective. You're ignoring the fact that  that there really was an opportunity to create a Palestinian state. There really was an opportunity to do what we did with Turkey and Greece, to do what we did with Pakistan and India, to create a partition, to do a population swap, to say the Arabs go over here, the Jews go over here, we live in peace, we have borders, we have the UN come in, a DMZ, like we have in Kosovo, like we have in North and South Korea, we can guarantee peace. We've done this before, we know how to do this. But it was these radical Zionists, these Likudniks, who said, no, we're going to blow up your whole project. We will do anything. The lowest of the low. Everyone's a child rapist. Hillary Clinton is literally raping children. QAnon stuff, yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. It's just it was the most low possible blow that you can think of preying upon a population of people who are increasingly basically schizophrenic who are lapping this stuff up sadistically, by the way, because a lot of these people are mediocre and what they want is an excuse to kill Bill Gates.  Because they think, oh, you know, I'm better than Bill Gates and Bill Gates is. And so they have this fantasy of, you know, crucify him, crucify him. And we're going to kill the elites and then we're going to take all their wealth. I mean, that's the implicit jealousy and motivation behind that. They'll just make up anything. So I think it's really sick, this whole saga that, you know, really, I mean, has come into the public consciousness in 2015 and 2016, continues to this day. And it's the fusion of basically the worst of wokeism, the worst of Me Too, with the worst of conspiracy theories all put together. And if you question it, if you say, you know what, these witnesses aren't reliable, you don't have any evidence,  Yes, Jeffrey Epstein committed illegal acts with teenagers. You know, he deserved to go to jail for that. But that is that does not you don't you can't then jump from that to they're raping babies and tunnels under a comet ping pong and so on. And that kind of moral absolutism. It is a.  It is like a nuclear bomb. Well, let me back up here just a little bit. I have some bigger things that I want to talk about, but let me back up just a little bit in terms of there's no evidence. Because there... When Jeffrey Epstein's homes were raided, there were reportedly hard drives and hard drives worth of material, no doubt sexual material in his closet. And these are in some like the they're right next to the Ark of the Covenant and some government archiver or something like that. secondly let me speak up for the victims if you want to put quotes on that you may just one thing so I do agree that it takes two to tango and I think these victims are a little bit unfortunate or non-ideal in this sense they're all hot they're all hot chicks and If you are hot, you're born that way, you are more likely or if you have a certain personality disposition, you're more likely to go into a sensual profession. You are likely to gravitate to massage.  Now, I don't think all masseuses are prostitutes. I got in trouble thinking that one time. I just walked in. I was on vacation, just walked in naked to a massage parlor, and they called the police on me. That was so rude.  Very unreasonable. No, just kidding. Not all masseuses or prostitutes, but many are. And even if you don't want to be a prostitute, you gravitate towards that sort of sensual profession. Many of these women were promised by Ghislaine that, do you want to be a Victoria's Secret model? I know people.  And so they had a little ambition going on there. They weren't, in most all cases, they weren't snatched from their bedrooms and kidnapped and thrown to the island. Maybe there are cases of that, but most all of them, it takes two to tango. They had a little bit of ambition. They went back to the Epsteins. uh mansion over and over they maintained contact with the epsteins afterward maybe they thought you know this was terrible i was molested by the epsteins but you know i still want to be a victoria's secret model and i so i and and there's no doubt that when you have that type of personality and you're hot you are also a narcissist and so we have a lot of these women heavily botoxed  uh on stage saying things some of which are untrue but Even if they're not ideal witnesses, I do chafe a bit at what I've seen from Michael Tracy, and I guess Hanani has jumped on this boat, of just tearing down the whole thing due to individual problems. It's a kind of composition fallacy. Did Shakespeare misspell a word in Hamlet? Oh, I can't believe you misspelled that word. What a terrible play.  That's fallacious. And so I do feel like you're looking at, say, Guifre, however you pronounce her name, who committed suicide. She might very well be traumatized. She might be mentally unstable to begin with.  And you're looking at that and saying, she said things that are wrong. She's recanted multiple times. She wasn't even used in the trial because she's an unreliable witness. She recanted things she said about Dershowitz, I believe. And he's bragged about this.  But focusing on those details, are you just losing the big picture? Where you're saying, look at this shiny object over here. You're not seeing the forest. And the forest is, again, even you would admit, this looks a hell of a lot like a black male cult.  a compromise situation or at the very least could easily be used in that way. And they're collecting like Pokemon. You have to have them all. They're collecting all of the movers and shakers from Steven Pinker to Bill Clinton to the wheelchair science guy. And you're going to just blackmail them all with the sex ring because men, if we've got one failing, it is pussy. Yeah.  And it's the one true way to get what you want. And so even if the victims are not ideal and they're mentally unstable, that doesn't mean that they're wrong. I want to make a very simple point about the blackmail claim, which is that if I was Benjamin Netanyahu and I wanted to, you know, have the the Juden Reich have this, you know, basically this axis Zionism emulating the Nazis sort of thing. You know, I would blackmail people like, for instance, you know, Lindsay, Lindsay Graham, you know, it's like I would I would find, you know, maybe he I don't even want to make an allegation. Right. But it's like maybe Lindsey Graham did something terrible. There's a little light in the loafers. He's a little light in the loafers and maybe he did something unthinkable and there's blackmail on him. And Netanyahu was using that to make him a slave for Israel. Like that is a compelling narrative, I think. But when you list off all these friends of Jeffrey Epstein, they were not dedicated slaves of Israel. And Bill Clinton was the guy who campaigned against Netanyahu and  Barack Obama was the guy who did the Iran deal. Why? He did it because in 2013, Netanyahu refused to come to the table and do a two-state solution. And Obama just pushed and pushed and pushed it. And Netanyahu wouldn't give an inch. He said, OK, well, I'm doing an Iran deal then. That's your punishment. And when you want to come back to the table and have a peace process, then maybe we can rethink the Iran deal. But he treated him that way.  And and all of the people on Epstein's friend list. And I do believe he was friends with these people. I also think he was a narcissist and narcissists have friends. But the way they have friends is very weird. So like he had this painting of Bill Clinton in a dress because he had this kind of like sick, you know, he enjoyed kind of humiliating his friends. And so all of these tapes.  We don't have the tapes, right? So we can speculate. And so the first speculation is that it's all child rape. There's no evidence for that. The second speculation is that Jeffrey Epstein basically had a bunch of hot of age models, over 18 models around him at all times. I kind of detail in the article how Jewish financiers in the 1980s would hold these same kind of parties. He didn't invent these types of parties. The Epstein parties, Epstein's Island, all of that is old hat. It's nothing new. And you have just hot women, hot young women around. And because, as you said, these women are strivers, they're trying to get somewhere in Hollywood or the industry. And so you don't even need to pay them. They just voluntarily sleep with these men. And everyone is happy with the arrangement until 30 years later when, you know, you know, they didn't get the career that they wanted. And now they're bitter and now they want some revenge. But, you know, that was what Epstein was doing. And I think it's possible that he like recorded his friends having sex. He did that because he's a weirdo. He's a pervert. He's a narcissist. Not because he wanted to blackmail his friends and destroy and force them to be slaves for Israel. That's not what was going on, you know, and especially in specifically about this Ehud Barak versus Netanyahu dichotomy.  you don't donate $3 million to Netanyahu's opposition. If, you know, it's just like this monolithic, all the Jews are together and happy and Netanyahu doesn't rail against Epstein and push the investigation against Epstein. If he's just, they're all on the same team. They're not, they're just, they legitimately hate each other for real substantive reasons that are relevant. If you're, you know, a Western, if you're an American and, And you don't want this, you know, anchor of Israel around your neck, this, you know, wheelstone or whatever it's called. You know, this this internal dispute among Jews and among Israelis is relevant because. whoever comes out on top, they now have, they can marshal the intelligence resources of Israel, which are formidable. They can marshal, you know, and they can coordinate with AIPAC and these lobbying organizations. So it's this entire ecology that when you're the head of state of Israel, that impacts America. And so that should, like, we should want...  The lesser of two evils, at least. And I think in this case, Jeffrey Epstein was the lesser of two evils, even though as a person, I'm speaking politically, as a person, narcissist, creep, weirdo, pervert, did weird things like with his friends, like recorded his friends having sex. The other alternative I'll mention is that he was gathering intelligence. He was an intelligence agent at the end of the day. um and you know i think that he was working for american intelligence and i think part of that was you have conversations and you record those conversations so when you see a tape that says you know bill clinton on it it's not necessarily bill clinton having sex it could be bill clinton revealing state secrets  that various intelligence services want. So yeah, that is my simplest point possible is that a blackmail scheme makes total sense for Lindsey Graham. It makes absolutely no sense for George Soros and Bill Clinton and Bill Gates and those sorts of people. The only oddball that I see is Alan Dershowitz. He's much further to the right than a lot of those other characters.  And I kind of talk in the article about, you know, but he wasn't always that way. He was more of a promoting a Palestinian state, even though he's he's obviously as strong a Zionist as they come. Yeah, I mean, he's had kind of a personal transformation, but that's the only sort of fly in the ointment. But otherwise, it's like all these people. And again, none of these people are like Nazis. None of these people are like Nazis.  Father Coughlin or whatever people expect out of him. Like, obviously, all these people are Zionists at the end of the day. They believe in Israel's right to exist. And so they are Zionists in the way that, you know, Joe Biden said, I'm a Zionist. Right. But at the same time, they are putting so much more pressure and limitations on Israel than the alternative, which is this Netanyahu Trump alliance where anything goes and there's just no restraint whatsoever. And, you know, I say that as kind of like a in a sort of self-hating way, because it's like, I wish that liberal internationalism had won the day in 2000. You know, I wish that Al Gore won the election and we had a Palestinian state and we had a population. The Camp David Accords in the 90s. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It's like it's like I wish that liberalism proved itself to be this competent system that can overcome these challenges. But it's just like these these what I call the axis Zionist because, you know, before Netanyahu. Shamir, the leader of Likud, in 1942, he was reaching out to the Germans and saying, give us guns so we can fight the British. It's like that kind of biting the hand that feeds you and backstabbing and just virulent anti-Anglo attitudes on the part of Likud. this hostility it's not even it's not it's not a generalized goyim thing it's like specifically they actually hate like the british and the anglo-americans and they they'd rather you know support the russians or they'd rather support the chinese just because they aren't the british because they have this historical memory of oh well if the british didn't blockade if they just let you know the jews of europe escape the holocaust you know so they actually blame The British more than they blame Hitler for the Holocaust in there, you know, that's their kind of logic, whether, you know, right or wrong. That's the way that they see it. And so it's like actually, you know, in a secret way, it's not it's not Hitler. In fact, Hitler is an ally because he did the transfer agreement. The British didn't do a transfer agreement.  Hitler was the greatest thing for Zionism that ever happened. And so in a way, they have this kind of weird respect, like, yeah, well, if we were goys, we would be like Hitler, too. You know, that's the attitude that you see as someone like a, you know, Acosta Nala Mario or something. It's like this mutual begrudging respect of like, you know what? You know, I can kind of as a Jew, I can understand a Nazi or as a Nazi, I can kind of understand a Jew rather than that the liberal internationalist, which is just totally horrified by both sides and and wishes there was some alternative. But, you know, history has unfolded. You know, what has been done has been done. And we can't undo that and just say, like.  Well, let's go back to the drawing board of the Palestinian peace process. Give it one old shot. Maybe if we can get a Democrat in in 2028, we can turn this thing around. Now, at some point, you have gone too far. And Israel at this point, I believe, has kind of entered this escape trajectory where even if we withdrew all the foreign aid and we started to sanction them and we did... You know what? They would just turn to the Chinese. They would just turn to the Russians. And they would...  provide immeasurable intelligence benefits to this Eurasianist project. Because, as I said, the Chinese have no aggressive forward velocity into the world. They don't want to dominate the world. The Russians are basically being cucked by the Chinese. Their economy is hanging on by a thread because of Chinese support. So they're a non-entity. But it's the Israelis who actually possess that kind of, you know, Kalergi said this, that they actually possess that aggressive spirit that pushes things forward. And so if you combine, and that's basically what Bolshevism did, is it took a Jewish elite and put it in charge of this highly fertile Slavic mass, and they industrialized the country in a couple of decades and made it into a war machine. so there is a precedent for you know jews doing this of taking over system which are which are inert in and of themselves but actually taking that mass and and organizing it in such a way that it gains a vector uh and i think that's what you would you would basically see the relationship between israel and china developing if if we did take that posture of like well we're just going to  kick Israel out of the United Nations or something, they would say, okay, well, fuck you. And now we're going to burn it down even harder. You thought we were going hard against you before? Now we're really going to go hard against you. So we are, whether we like it or not, this Jewish civil war, which basically has been won by Likud, it affects all of us. So it's not something I think that...  You can say, well, I wish that the Jewish state had never appeared. I wish that Zionism had never happened. It was a tragedy from the beginning. You can hold that position, but what has been done has been done. And so moving forward, I think there, I mean, my position is sort of fatalistic and just like, I don't see any potentiality for some AOC-type figure to come to power and to turn the ship around and say, no, no, no, we're going to do it this time. It's over. Like, Palestine is over. Israel won, and we're going to have to... just move on in some way and try to kind of clear up the wreckage and to make the best that we can out of it. But that two-state solution has been dead, and people are clinging to that, and they're trying to resurrect it. I think it's a fool's errand, and you just sort of have to move on while recognizing, yeah, go ahead. I totally agree with that. I want to just break in really quick, because you mentioned the fly in the ointment of your theory was Dershowitz.  Is Trump another fly in the ointment? Because...  You know, Trump talks about how he loved Democrats or he's he's a conservative on most things. But the Democrats are right on that. That was sort of the Trump we knew in the 90s, the Reform Party Trump. And even in 2016, you had talk of national health care and he did not play the culture war sort of remarkably, did not bash gays or anything like that. And I think a lot has changed after 2020.  But what I mean is this. Trump is in line with all of these right-wing Republicans who say that Bibi Netanyahu is their best friend. And that goes from Mitt Romney to Ted Cruz to Lindsey Graham. I love Bibi. We were having lunch the other day talking about the West and civilization and Christ and all this kind of stuff that they talk with him about. Trump is in line with them. Trump gave Israel.  maybe not everything that it wanted, but pretty damn close. Golan Heights, embassy movement, et cetera. Trump has said some critical things, but you have to read about Israel and gossip. You have to read between the lines. So it's basically...  It's got to stop. This is a terrible war. It's making all of us look really bad is basically what he said. He did not stand up on behalf of the Palestinians. It was basically like this. The optics of this thing have have gone out of control, which is, of course, right about. So in Trumpism, maybe not in 2016. But definitely now, you see this MAGA alignment with the third worldism that you associate with the Likud, the Israeli far right. Bibi Netanyahu campaigned with giant posters of Vladimir Putin in making these appeals to these Russian Jews, maybe dubious Jews who came over from the Soviet Union and were still Russian nationalists. out outright maga as well it's it's bizarre for me as a 40 something year old person where the far right in the united states is now pro-russia and blames nato that is the exact opposite of the situation that i at least perceived when i was a young person uh during the cold war  So MAGA is third world aligned. MAGA wants a multipolar world. If you say MAGA, they almost attack George W. Bush for the wrong reasons or something like that. Like, we don't want to go back to the neocons where, you know, we're tipping over, we're jumping over borders and influencing people. We actually want to, you know...  get really ensconced in this nation where we're terrifying everyone. We have no connections. Why would you even want to travel? We don't like you, but you don't like us. That's great. We're just going to be these nationalists within our own border. It's a third world ideology. It's going against what made America great to be honest. and what made america powerful what allowed america to win the cold war was not the fact that we were nationalistic and terrifying our allies and and and enemies alike uh it just isn't and so maga itself has become a sort of multi-polar third world force where they it wants to tear down the american empire  And so you have this sort of, I don't know, Trump is a fascinating figure. If we agree with your theory, which I'm much more inclined to after reading your article and talking with you, I do think that you have offered a key that can unlock a lot of doors about it.  Trump himself becomes a fly in the ointment or an ambiguous or even tragic figure. Because in the 80s, up through the Reform Party period, Trump is sort of a liberal. He's a pro-America, big-talking, rich-as-hell liberal. And he's now in control of MAGA that is inexorably, I believe, moving towards a kind of third world ideology, an anti-unipolar, anti-American empire. Right. ideology and so he's kind of caught in between because if there's one thing that is going to bring down trump and thus bring down a lakud aligned leader of the united states it might be these damn epstein files So if your theory is correct, that these were directed, this is a Likud, the Epstein obsession is a kind of Likud operation directed at liberals who are Zionists, to be sure, but very willing to engage in a peaceful settlement with the Palestinians, including nationhood for the Palestinians. This was the Epstein obsession is directed against them. Then Trump is getting caught in the crosshairs. And it's sort of a remarkable situation because, again, I don't I would say all other maybe they think Trump is dispensable because all other Republicans, the other competing forces in the Republican Party are like the religious right, say Ted Cruz and company or neocons, as they call them, like Lindsey Graham. And they're going to be pro-Lakut as well. Maybe Trump.  Maybe they're going to get rid of Trump and put in someone who is equally as sycophantic. Thoughts?  Yeah, it is a tragic thing. I mean, we love Donald Trump, folks. He's the greatest. It's hard. He taps into an avuncular, warm, friendly. For all of his narcissism, it's a warm narcissism. It's like, yeah, the guy's pompous and he's buffoonish, but it's lovable. And it just shows you how... yeah these these sometimes these terms are are you know he is in a in a sense like a one-dimensional figure in a good way that he doesn't have these infinite layers of complexity where he you know he he contemplates himself you know you ask him like you know what do you pray about and he's just like well i just do things you know i just i think you just got to keep doing things yeah prayer is a waste of time or i think at one point they said like do you believe in god and he was like  evangelical Christians. They voted for me. They love me. Of course I believe in God. Like that's how he thinks he's never like had a dark night of the soul where he's like, is God real? I don't know. Like he's never had that moment. It's just like these people love me. And I love that. I love you that you love me kind of thing. Remarkable man. Correct.  He's kind of like, you know, a child in the goods. I mean, like Nietzsche's discussion of the weight of memory. You have to overcome that. It's like, you know, in some ways he doesn't remember the lies he told yesterday. And so he's a fresh and he's a new man and he's youthful because of that. And so there is something aspirational about becoming embodying the Trump archetype in terms of his personality, that is what has buoyed him past these bankruptcies and these failures and these divorces, things that would have ruined other people, things that would have driven people to suicide. I mean, his brother overdosed on alcohol. I mean, these and he decided he had made a pact. He's just never going to drink. And he made a pact with his children like you guys aren't going to drink either. So he is a man who has these strong moral convictions, even if You know, he's he's also corrupt and he also has crypto schemes and, you know, but it's like there is definitely good in Donald Trump. And anyone who can't like admit that or recognize that just has a very superficial partisan polarized view of of reality and humanity. So, yeah, I agree that, you know, he was a man who wanted to become president. He you know, he had this mentor with Roy Cohn.  And then he moved on to Roger Stone and Paul Manafort. And Stone and Manafort are like, you know, directly report to, I mean, as far as anybody that I can think of who's just like, you know, you can say Lindsey Graham, but Lindsey Graham actually...  you know, he's not very smart. Like Lindsey Graham is not really a political operative in the way that Manafort and Stone have totally... And I've actually... I mean, you have more experience with this than I do, but, you know, I've spoken with a couple of these people who are like... involved with Roger Stone is getting quite old now but you see that he like engineered in the same way that Robert Maxwell engineered this global media empire a man like Robert or excuse me a man like Roger Stone kind of created this media this subterranean media apparatus that all these machinations and backroom deals and you know calling people up and planting stories and TMZ it's like He is an operator in those dark shadows, and he is the guy who went to Trump and said, look, Trump, I know you think you're a liberal Democrat and you think that you just have this kind of basic bitch view or this intuitive view of the world.  But I'm going to let you in on a secret. You need to marry off your daughter into the Kushner family because that's your entry into Netanyahu's good graces. Because you know what? Bill Clinton's fucked up. Bill Clinton stood against Netanyahu. And you know what? Netanyahu won. And you know what that tells you? Netanyahu is more powerful than Bill Clinton. So you don't fuck with Netanyahu. So if you want to survive and you want to become president, you need to get good with that guy and you need to fight the Clintons. And that back and forth, those discussions between Trump and Roger Stone went on for basically 15 years before he actually said, OK, now we're going to put the plan into action. It's all going to roll out. And Trump didn't understand every little bit. He didn't understand the Israeli botnets with QAnon. I mean, things were just happening. The idea that Trump was coordinating, he was talking, he was conspiring. No, Trump was  a reality TV star. And the star of the show is not the director. The star of the show is not the script writer. So the blame and culpability that we put on Trump has to be limited by that fact. And we have to really look at the real villain, you know, the worm tongue pulling the strings as people like Roger Stone.  And the guy's kind of a genius. I mean, he's sort of an evil genius. But he came up with this plan to win in 2016. And it was an international conspiracy with the Israelis to get it done. It was a huge upset victory. It was like Nate Silver had the best prediction. It was like 38% Trump winning, maybe even lower than that. So it's a huge one of the greatest upsets in political history of all time.  And these people pulled it off. So there's definitely competence. There's definitely genius. And the liberal internationalists who, you know, I look back and I'm sort of, you know, rooting for them in time. And like, as these events happen, I'm like, oh, what if it went another way? Or what if this happened? And it's like, you know, the liberal internationalists had guys like Jeffrey Epstein, who and maybe I'm Jeffrey Epstein's greatest defender or whatever in a political sense. But on a personal level, the guy was a scumbag.  And he actually wasn't an effective operator. He actually should have. He actually, you know, if he was the point man for this like counter Likud action, you know, he should have done a lot more and he should have done it better. And he should have, you know, whatever. I mean, he should have been as conniving and skillful as Roger Stone. And he wasn't. He was a fuck up.  He started taking steroids in middle age, which made him basically careless and reckless. And he started engaging in this terrible illegal activity, totally needless, shot himself in the foot. The guy was a billionaire. I mean, he had built up this huge wealth.  And then he ends up committing suicide. All of that money that's now frozen in this estate that's going to be divvied up one way or another, that could have gone toward this cause, toward this quest. And at the end of the day, it's just like Epstein was a fundamentally cynical figure. I mean, maybe he had some eugenicist commitments or he believed in improving humanity and freezing his balls and sperm and whatever. He had these transhumanist ideas.  But it was so shallow and superficial. Yeah, compare that to the Zionists who are calling for the death of the prime minister in the streets. Those people have fanaticism. Those people believe in something. Jeffrey Epstein, at the end of the day, it was flaccid. It was impotent what he was pushing. And so I think that's the lesson that if that liberal internationalists want to correct the mistakes that were made by Epstein and all of his associates, it's getting a little more fanatical. It's getting a little more zealous and tapping into the power that is there, recognizing it and not just being like, oh, well, wouldn't it be cool? Like these fucking world leaders on a hot mic being like, oh, Xi Jinping is talking to Putin, but wouldn't it be cool if we could live to be 150 instead of dying at age 80? Like, ooh, isn't that neat? It's like this Reddit tier. That's not great. Extending gerontocracy and the geriatric state of life is not greatness. There has to be something beyond near extension of life, spreading the butter ever more thinly over the bread. There has to be some oomph. There has to be some,  you know, predatory spirit that that possesses man takes him to something higher. So that's the that's the spirit that that I think should be injected into liberalism. I'm not a big you know, I'm not a big Newsome guy just because I don't think he's going to win the primary. But I think that is like an intimation of what that looks like, what it looks like to put a predatory spirit injected back into liberalism and say, no,  we're not just going to be trampled by these third worldists. I mean, it literally is like the lion waking up from the jackals, biting him and being like, okay, I'm going to war. Like, you're not going to do this to me anymore. So, you know, I think that that potential is always there. You know, getting that to have, you know, waking the lion up from its slumber when it is such a large and cumbersome beast is another story.  Yes. In terms of the Israel situation, I completely agree with your assessment that there was a civil war and perhaps the Likud side won. Leading up to October 7th, we forget, was a months-long sit-in protest that done by liberal zionists against netanyahu's netanyahu's judicial reforms and basically saying this guy's going to have absolute power uh we don't like him or or trust him all of that is water under the bridge at this point i mean netanyahu i i mean can anyone quite imagine him being prosecuted for corruption and sent to jail at this point i i think it's much easier to imagine him engaging in a new front on the west bank and seizing the territory and so it seems like a lot of things that were simmering have have finally come to a boil and so when when zion when the  Zionist entity was first created, you had to deal with this ethnic question. We're a Jewish state. There are people who are already here on the land. And looking forward, we're going to get into a demographic situation.  birth situation that is maybe untenable for a Jewish state and certainly disadvantageous. So how do we solve this issue? Do we do a complete genocide process?  Just wipe them all out. And we're just going to be Joshua 2.0 and Canaan is ours, greater Israel. That's one solution, of course. Is that politically feasible after the Second World War? And...  And so on. That's another question. Another option would be the one state solution, which I think a lot of left liberals are moving towards, which is basically, yeah, let's have one state. It's Israel. And everyone on this territory will receive equal rights, etc. And you're just going to get into a demographic situation that makes anything in the United States and Europe possible. seem like child's play it will not be it will no longer have a jewish character uh just simply due to demographics at least in time another option which seems to be what bibi netanyahu pursued for decades is the the the kick the can down the road through occupation  So we are going to occupy the West Bank. Gaza, ditto. We'll give them a little sovereignty, but it's a tiny little plot of land. And we'll surround them and turn it into an open-air concentration camp, etc. And we'll just kind of keep giving a little bit of lip service to the two-state solution, but we'll basically say...  Not possible. They're terrorists. And while you're making them terrorists, you might literally be funding terrorist organizations. At the very least, the presence of Jewish soldiers in the West Bank or even Palestinian Arabs operating seemingly...  in the perception of the people there on behalf of Israel. It's terrible. You're going to create terrorists. No question about it. And now that decades-long Likud halfway point seems to be ending. Gaza is absolutely destroyed at this point. And there is no... reason to believe that you can build a Palestinian, a discontinuous Palestinian state on that territory. There is a lot of chatter about a full on invasion of the West Bank and seizing of the West Bank. There's reporting about. who is the Adelson, the gambling tycoon, giving $100 million to Trump or something like that, with the verbal assurance that he's going to allow West Bank annexation. Now, is that true or not? I don't quite know, but at least that thought is in the air. So we seem to, as you said before, we seem to have just crossed the Rubicon on all of these questions.  I don't think a Palestinian state is viable. I think this notion of Palestinian nationalism, it had its moment. And I think that moment was the late 1990s and Rabin was killed. The whole thing failed.  And an infatata terrorist action was launched against Israel. It just it's not workable. You cannot build a Palestinian state on rubble and the bones of dead children. I mean, it's just we've passed it. So, I mean, what what else is there outside of greater Israel as a paradigm for the Israeli state at this point?  There's an inertia that's pushing things forward and there's just no there's no force. I mean, the Chinese don't want to stop Israel. The Russians don't want to stop Israel. The Arabs actually don't even really want to stop Israel. You look at their leadership.  And they're not even interested in stopping Israel. They'll take the bribe. They'll happily take the bribe. The Europeans will sort of weekly hold up a protest sign or something. But yeah, Europe has no power projection. Again, as I mentioned with France, in Africa, they won't even defend themselves. They're running away from the battle on all fronts.  And so it's like, is America going to step in and turn? No, because all of the so-called anti-Semitic or anti-Zionist force in America is now being funneled into the idea of, as you said, a third worldist paradigm, nationalism for all peoples. basically build the wall, deport them all, bring the troops home, and basically shut this whole project down. Let's go back to the 1770s when George Washington said it best, no entangling alliances, right, guys? Which the context of that was, hey, let's conquer the continent first. So it's like,  Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a context to that statement. But in any case, this is their mind. This is like their Bible, right? So they interpret the exegesis of what George... Yeah, because George Washington, he spoke the first commandment into the ether, into the holy tablets. And we just have to follow that like dogs forever. We can't have any critical thinking whatsoever. So that attitude...  Even if you had a Nick Fuentes presidency or something, right? It's like, what would that accomplish? And maybe Nick Fuentes is going to evolve on this issue or something. But I'm saying just in general, that kind of dissident, right, anti-Semitic, counter-Semitic, anti-Zionist, whatever they call themselves. That if they did take power, and they won't, but if they did, then it would just look like a global retreat and Israel would just turn to other benefactors and other patrons to continue doing what it's doing. So, yeah, there is no countervailing force. And so we should expect Israel to... And I call this basically Islamification in the sense of you talk to a man on the street in Jordan, you talk to a man on the street in Egypt, the average man on the street looks at Israel pretty negatively.  the governments of those countries don't give a fuck what the man on the street thinks. And they do what they want, which is they take the bribe and they shut up. And if the Muslim Brotherhood tries an insurrection, they shoot him down like dogs.  And they put down the insurrection. And that's what those governments do. And increasingly, that's what America is going to look like, is you're going to have a basal 56% white person in America who thinks increasingly negative things about Israel.  I mean, that's part of Likud's strategies. They want anti-Semitism to increase, to drive more Jews to Israel. They want more synagogue shootings, which is a tragic and horrifying thought, but they want that to happen so that Jews keep moving to Israel because they want...  the other 6 million, right? There's 6 million Jews in Israel. They want the 6 million Jews who are mostly in America to flee America. So they want to make America as anti-Semitic as possible, while at the same time making sure that the leadership of America, just like the leadership of Egypt and Jordan, is fully supportive of the state of Israel. So they want maximum low-tier working-class anti-Semitism to grade all these hate attacks, while at the same time maintaining  total elite control of the military apparatus of these countries. So it is, I mean, maybe that's an example of the Caduceus. Absolutely. Two things here. I mean, I've actually called this Spencer's Law, but I ripped off this idea from someone who's probably in the chat tonight named Brendan. And that is that the greatest anti-Semites and the greatest Philo-Semites vote for the same party. isn't that remarkable david duke and nick fuentes harsh anti-israel critics they are voting for the same party that ted cruz and lindsey graham are voting for hyper zionist  You know, let's bring on the book of Revelation now, you know, kind of type people. They're all voting for Trump. Is that some wild coincidence? Is that inexplicable? No, it actually might very well be explicable and it might very well fit a pattern that we've seen throughout my lifetime. So even if you think of BAP. this doesn't make sense he's a jew he's gay he lives in he's went to yale he lives in romania he loves bodybuilders but also he's like a nietzschean fascist badass you know quasi hitler lover or whatever it doesn't make sense maybe it does make sense because for decades during my lifetime  The biggest supporters of Israel wanted all of the Jews to die, basically. So the evangelical Christians, the, you know, Pastor Hagee type and the religious right and so on, they wanted an end time scenario in which most Jews would go up in flames and some would convert.  Yet they were the best friends, the staunchest allies of Israel for that reason. That was the dialectic. And it was actually Bill Clinton who opposed settlements, Herbert Walker Bush, also part of the old Anglo establishment to some degree, who opposed settlements, et cetera. Those people were not totally reliable allies in the way that the ostensibly at least anti-Semitic or at least insane religious right people were. So BAP comes at the end of that tradition. BAP isn't an aberration. He isn't some eccentric.  that we can't understand. He actually fits that pattern exactly. This is the new form of it, which is you can be based as hell. You could think fascism is just badass and so on. But you, like, and almost because of those beliefs, you are also going to support the Likud vision, which at this point is greater Israel's uh total muslim death uh kicking ass left and right put the you know put sit put throw the children to the flames ideology and and so that's where we are so like the third worldism that is emerging in bap in the religious right in maga in general  It fits the Likud paradigm, whereas the the sort of wasp liberal Americanism. We love NATO. We're scared of the Ruskies. That doesn't it doesn't work. And so like the more nationalists we get, and I have no doubt that Nick Flint went as personally is red pilling tons of people. uh uh you know through his comedic routines and rhetoric and and insight and so on he is really reaching the masses in a way that frankly i'm not and and you you are not as well and i don't mean that as a as a criticism in the slightest  I want to blue pill the masses, so I'm good with that. Exactly. We want to put the wool over their eyes, in fact. And Nick himself is complicated and has the capacity to evolve. And I mean that very seriously. But he's sort of red-pilling them in the way that they're becoming more...  racist and out of control and just like hating the Jews, etc. Again, maybe there's some good things about that. Maybe it has to happen. You could make lots of different arguments. But all that I would say is that the red-pilled racist and anti-Semitic community is no enemy to  to Israel. In fact, in a Caducean complicated way, Likud and the third world racist fanatics are aligned and they can work together and they have historically worked together for close to a half century.  That's completely right. And I'll even say, like, I'll do a BAP apologia and just say, you know, I'll see things where he says, you know, I mean, he will actually parrot those points of saying there is a rise of third worldism on the right. Actually, Putin is a third world is actually, you know, what's going on in Russia today is nothing glorious. It's not the revival of white Christian civilization. It's actually demographic decline, mass Muslim immigration, Sigma boy. I mean, it's it's it's all the same stuff. And it's happening at a slower rate just because Russia is systematically less competent at everything, including. cultural decline, you know, so it's not like it's not, you know, they're they're saved by their own stupidity to an extent. But that's not really a lot of that's not something anyone should aspire to. And so, you know, I think he he has  the self-awareness to recognize the critiques that you're making. But I also think, and Nick Fuentes is the same as he will say things of like, yeah, this third worldism is getting out of control. No, we shouldn't just irrationally hate Jews. We don't hate, you know, we're Christians. We love everybody. And we have to like distinguish ourselves from low IQ antisemitism. And I see those two figures saying that as a kind of a remorseful, regretful, you know, they have contributed to this. and and this thing has inertia you gave this thing a push it's headed off a cliff and now you're trying to reel it back in and save the train from and it's like the train has already begun its descent off the cliff you are not pulling that train back up out of that chasm it is going down and so you can kind of throw in a caveat and say oh no guys when i meant  Heil Putin and we love Putin and all of this shit. No, not like that. It was a joke, I swear. And it's like, I see these figures having that level of self-recognition. It's too little, too late. And I will even give them this, that they are ultimately small figures. And I don't mean to demean  The artistic performance quality. For instance, Alex Jones. Alex Jones is an amazing performer. He's someone I totally disagree with. I think his politics are horrendous, but he has amazing talent. But, you know, if it wasn't Alex Jones and it was, you know, Owen Schroyer or something, you know, someone who's really less entertaining, like they would just...  you know, hire two old insurers, you know, to compensate for the loss of Alex Jones. So it's like, we think that these online thought leaders, these e-celebs, and maybe I'm like hypocritical in this respect because I put out my opinions or whatever, but it's like on some level,  it doesn't matter. What matters are incentives. What matters are botnets. And this is in terms of political power, is that if you have an intelligence service that has the ability to just spam comment sections 24-7 and to manufacture consent around an Epstein panic or a QAnon or a Pizzagate, if you have the power to do that, It doesn't matter how many right-wing dissidents wake up and realize, oh, shit, I'm kind of part of the problem. Maybe we should bump the brakes on this. Like, it doesn't matter. They will replace you. And again, I think you have the self-awareness, Richard, to say, like, you played that role, and then you were like, I don't want to play this role. I don't want to be a clown in this circus anymore. And you know what? They just found a dozen other dumber, less handsome, less charismatic Richard Spencers to put in your place to keep the train running, which is... horrifying because it's like what it's like invasion of the body snatchers you wake up and one day all these people who uh you know it's like have no it's like no it's a total herd animal behavior they they are yeah lemmings running off the cliff they don't have the ability to critically look at themselves like what are we actually accomplishing here what is actually happening in reality  Yeah, we're red-pilling people. What does that mean if the actual demographics of the America First audience and movement are declining at the same rate as the demographics of America? More intensely, I would say. Yeah. Yeah. America First is becoming much blacker than the Republican Party and browner. It's remarkable.  Yeah, I do think Nick is actually aware of this on some level. I saw a clip the other day where someone was saying, like, do you trust the medical establishment? And he was just basically like, listen up. This guy spent eight years in undergraduate college studying biology and then another four at medical school, and he's done an internship. Yes, he should fight your cancer and not the discord forum that you are a part of. Nick needs to be careful because he's going to be replaced the same way you were replaced. If he keeps doing that, they're going to find a new Nick Fuentes to replace him. Yeah.  The incentive against self-reflection is very high, and that is deeply sad. It's the Schopenhauer's basically attitude, and it's correct. And so, you know, you do need some, whether you call it stoicism or Buddhist attachment or something, you do need to just kind of like... you know go okay all right so yes these cycles of history will repeat themselves endlessly people make the same mistakes um and yeah you have to on some level see yourself above that and you know ask what you can do and not um  you know, bang your head against the wall, trying to steer it because it's like the audience. It's almost sometimes when we say like, Oh, Nick Fuentes is red pilling people. He is fundamentally changing them. He's activating them. He is introducing new knowledge. And it's like,  I'm kind of skeptical of that. I think what's actually happening is that these people were already disaffected by larger voices. And what Fuentes has done is he sort of sharpened the image. He's kind of increased the granularity of their hatred. So instead of just hating life and say, I fucking hate my life and I hate the politicians or whatever, now it's like, no, I hate...  my gay liberal Jewish life. And I hate these gay liberal Jewish politicians. So you've kind of given these signs and signifiers that make people feel like we're getting closer to the truth. We're getting more accurate. We're getting more precise in our language and our hatred. And therefore, you know, we're closer to a solution because the more pedantic you get, the more precise you get in their hatred, that the more powerful the hatred becomes. But if you think about hatred as a sheer energy, that actually narrowing your hatred into these little dogmas does not empower your hatred, it entraps it. And so in a way, that general societal resentment, that general societal dissent, which is a revolutionary potential that can be actualized by a Napoleon or a Lenin or a Hitler or whoever, When you take that and you dogmatize it into a small little America first worldview, pray the rosary and we're Catholics guys and go back to church and all of these little, you know, second religiousness, we're going to emulate, we're going to worship, you know, the cargo cult of the burnt out church of the empty church, the Latin mass.  that is really kind of subversive in a way. And it'd be better if you just didn't give people anything at all. Because what you need to do, rather than red-pilling people, if you want to change, and this is kind of how Israel acts, and to the extent that Epstein was an actor, this is how he acted. These people don't go to the masses and convince them directly. They do it indirectly. They have these this they build up massive power, billions of dollars, and then they activate and then they use these tools of mass control to get the opinions that they want to manufacture that consent. And that strategy, I think, over millennia has proved itself to be the superior strategy over, you know, The myth of Jesus walking around and red pilling people on the gospel, because that's where all this red pill stuff comes from. It comes from Jesus. Oh, he just walked around and argued with people all day Talmudically. And then they accepted, you know, the New Testament. They accepted this book that hadn't even been read yet. I don't know. They accepted Christ as their savior. New covenant. So charismatic. Yeah. I mean, Jesus and Nick Fuentes are occupying the same archetype, but it's a deceptive archetype. There's a lie being told there, which is that's not actually how Christianity spread. It spread from the top down by going to the Germanic kings and converting them. And then they enforce that on the population. So I think the red pill mythology is just deeply wrong. Hmm.  Very well stated. John, you have a question? You can jump in. Yeah, I mean, on the subject of, you know, maybe an inevitable attempt to replace Nick Fuentes...  I think we already reached that point. I mean, what do you think they were trying to do with Patrick Casey, you know, a couple years ago, or somebody like a John Doyle? I mean, these are inherently replacements that they were trying to groom to usurp his position as the voice of the Zoomers. yeah yeah i mean i i think also tucker is treading into alex jones territory in his own unique way bringing up these conspiracies about 9 11 or you know nato and the russian invasion of ukraine and and just going straight cutting cutting through any pretense and just talking about demon possession  You know, just going straight for the jugular of right wing stupidity and insanity.  I agree with that. Yeah. Well, anyone else want to ask a question? I think this has been a great discussion. I like it when I'm forced to rethink things. And I after reading your article and then speaking with you, I'm much, much, much more inclined to your position on the Epstein question. And I wasn't before I was going with the flow.  So we'll see where I end up. But I but I think it's very good just to, again, not to have these kind of overly broad categories like the Jews, you know, and et cetera. And and understand I mean, Jews exist, obviously, as a category. But to understand, actually, there are these very strong divisions. There's a little mini civil war going on that you have to recognize or you're you're just going to be speaking in platitudes.  All right. So we have two questions or three questions now. So regular guy, do you want to jump in?  So you mentioned Trump's refusal to drink alcohol, which due to his alcoholic brother. You know, if you've seen the great movie The Apprentice, Love Trump or Hate Trump, it's an amazing movie. I couldn't recommend it more. But how much do you think that stems from him being a narcissist and wanting to be in control all the time? For example, I've met a lot of narcissists who are into being straight edge because They have these egos and they need to be in control at all the time and they can't get out of their head. And they're larger than life characters and they can be quite useful or dangerous depending on what side of them you're on.  I mean, you're describing Adolf Hitler and you're also describing me. I mean, I'm straight edge. Hitler was straight edge. Trump is straight edge. I mean, nothing you said is wrong. But I also think that just points to this fact that we also have to just as maybe we're going to say there's good and bad Jews, we should also say there's good and bad narcissists.  And there's good and bad forms of narcissism. And if that if narcissism can pull you together, you know, for whatever motivation, you know, your self aggrandizement, your own pride, but it can it can force you to, you know, put down the booze and become the president of the United States. Like, maybe that's good. Maybe we need more of that. Oh, every great artist. is a narcissist has been a narcissist every not so great artist the dancer at your local theater troupe is no doubt a clinical narcissist and there's something good about that the normies don't do interesting things that's sort of in their nature so hail narcissism uh i mean we have we've got to be honest here you know You guys, not probably most people in this group, but most Americans want to watch football on Sunday. It's like hail psychopathy. I mean, you have to be a psychopath to do something like that. You have to appreciate mental illness for what it's worth and not try to cure it or demonize the so-called mentally ill who are actually the straw that stirs the drink in world history and culture.  If you remove all narcissism, you just, yeah, you get screaming sports fans. You get hysteria. I mean, hysteria is sort of the opposite of narcissism. It's no less hateful or vicious. It's just the mob rather than the single individual striving. Right. It seems that for every thousand TikToks calling out a narcissistic ex, a narcissistic character, there's one or maybe even less than one calling out the hysterical TikTok user themselves. Very true. Mad Max, you want to jump in?  Yeah, Joko, you got some pretty interesting, good takes. This is my first time ever seeing you. So if you wouldn't mind sharing for those of us who are just now being exposed to you, what's your story and background? And yeah, just tell us about yourself.  Gosh, I've been trying to write the autobiography for a while. I guess the speediest version of my life, I hated my eighth grade history teacher, English teacher. But for whatever reason, he was teaching us history. And so he printed out a picture of baby Hitler. And he stood in front of the class and he said, all right, class, everyone come up with a different way that you would kill baby Hitler. Oh, man.  And then after that, he was like, all right, class. Now, tomorrow, make sure. I don't remember if we had to sign the permission slip to watch the Holocaust footage or to get out of it or which way. But I was the only kid in class who was like, I don't want to watch this. I don't want to do this.  And I was always that way. I didn't want to dissect the frog. I didn't want to watch the Holocaust footage. I didn't want to kill baby Hitler. And so I just was a contrarian. I was just always anti whatever the authorities were telling me. I just want to do the exact opposite. So, you know, I was like, well, I'm Jewish, but, you know, I believe in in. Right or wrong and good and bad, because, you know, prior, you know, a few years prior, I thought the Native Americans were good and white people were bad. That was sort of the narrative that I believed. And so if you had teleported me back to 1600, I'd be out there with a tomahawk and the feathers and I'd be. You know, doing the Indian war cry because I believe that they were on the side of the environment and animals and all of those good fuzzy things. So I already had this idea in my head of like, well, you know, I'm a white person and but. if there was a war between the whites and the natives, like I'd be that one white guy who would like, you know, stand up for what's right against my own interests because that's what the, you know, that's what the last say, you know, Tom Cruise is the last samurai. He's the white guy who fights with the samurai, you know? And so I was always, or even in a, you know, the Dune series, right? So you have that idea of like,  you know, the guy who sort of betrays his tribe and joins this other tribe. You know, Muhammad was maybe that kind of person, maybe a red haired person who led all these Arabs to victory. And there's that motif where you talked maybe about the Jews and the Slavs and that relationship. So I had that conception already. And then it sort of flipped. And I went from being this guy who was like, OK, I would I would fight the whites to save the Native Americans to now it's like, you know, the Sam Hyde clip where he's like, oh, Hitler needs me. OK, Hitler, I'll do it. I'll save Western civilization from from these Jews. And, you know, it's a weird thing.  Self-hating Jews are very weird people. And I'm not an exception to that. So, you know, I look back through old writings, you know, I have and I'm like, what on what level on that particular day was I, you know, trying to square that circle and trying to be like, well, you know, maybe Zionism is the solution or maybe maybe Christianity is the solution. I was just trying to figure out how to how to solve the problem.  And it was around 2021. I sort of built up a YouTube channel of like a thousand people. And I said, I'm going to travel around the country and anyone who wants to meet me, you know, just tell me where you are and I'll go meet you. So I started meeting, you know, dozens and dozens of people driving thousands of miles.  And I was involved at the time with Eric Orwell, I guess he's the Return to the Land guy. He didn't have that title at the time. But I actually went with him to Hawaii in 2015. Did you film any videos with Eric Orwell?  Yeah, we did some videos. Yeah, we did a podcast together called the Perennial Podcast. Oh, yeah. So I was making an allusion to his porn career. Yeah, I mean, that was I'm really glad that all came out because. um I guess he's like my nemesis uh because he sort of kicked me out of the alt-right or whatever he's sort of you know he he for for a long time like he was more left-wing and I was like no you have to read Mein Kampf and he was like I don't know I like  Maybe we shouldn't be anti-Semitic. And so for a while, like I was on the right wing and he was on the left wing. And then at some point we like pushed past each other and I was doing this deep left thing and I was becoming more critical of the right wing. And he was like associated more and more with white nationalists. And so we just like crossed paths and diverged. And instead of going toward each other, as we had been doing for years, we just started the distance between us.  grew so large that, you know, I started making that Liars on the Right series. And I don't know if I should apologize or if I should say you're welcome because that Richard Spencer impression I did was a Shakespearean. I had to do like 20 takes in the car. That was me embodying  That was an homage. I'm not offended. I think I was trying to get in communication with you, and then the next day you did an imitation of me, Liars on the Right, and I was like, oh, I guess...  But all's well that ends well. So I don't know. Yeah. No skin on my back. So so obviously during that period, I was like, all of my friends are Nazis. I want to stop being a Nazi. I need to, like, push everybody out of my life. And so that's what the Liars and the Right series accomplished. All of my former audience got sick of me. They hated me.  They don't like me anymore. And so it took me about two years to bury the dead on that and then to start the sub stack. And now I feel like I'm actually putting forth positive, constructive ideas rather than running away from, oh, no, I have this really embarrassing past and I have these personal relationships. And anyone who's been a part of a... An extremist political movement of any kind or you could call it a principled political movement knows that like if you decide to change your views that has massive personal repercussions and it's not just a. It's no longer in like a logical exercise it's like oh I you know I've just lost all my friends or something so.  Yeah, that was that was difficult, but I think I'm I guess I hope I'm better for it in the end. And now I'm spreading the gospel about how Jeffrey Epstein is a great guy. What a wonderful accomplishment with that one. Yeah. No, I I a lot of parallels with me. I mean, what you say in terms of your first to criticize Trump and everyone says what you said.  Six months ago, but you said it first and they resent you for it. I felt that I've absolutely lost tons of friends. Basically, everyone who I was connected with leading into 2016, I'm not connected with any of them. with the one exception of of mark brahman who didn't take part in 2016 at all and i he is the one that has remained yeah i i was connected with hanania someone mentioned that in the chat i was connected with richard anania well a long time ago that back in 2010 era things like that uh but yeah that that everything that led up to 2016 i don't speak to any of these people i don't think they would answer my call if i gave them a phone call i mean  uh, good riddance on some level, but, uh, it is, I'm not going to deny that it is painful. Um, the other thing that I agree with is I am sort of a self hating white in many ways. I mean, I, there is an element to REM theory and, uh, Apolloism that Mark refers to as breaking your toys. Um,  So it's like, you like James Bond? Well, let me tell you about James Bond. They're like, you think Homer is great? Ah, you know, let me tell you about that. You think that the Christian masses are on our side? Let me tell you. You have to be a little... demonic even i use that word advisedly i'm not possessed by anything but you have to you have to have a little demon that tells you to keep pushing against something that you took for granted for your whole life perhaps and yes i'm not trying to toot my own horn here but i i definitely have that and there's no doubt that i've lost  supporters because of my views. But you just have to be willing to fire customers like you have to be like, say, like, look, I'm I'm going on this journey. I'm a reasonable, respectful person. If you want to come with me on this journey and offer critical feedback or or what have you. Great. You're welcome. But if you don't want to come on this journey, then see you later, because I am not going to ever pander to you. And I think my audience recognizes I listen to everyone and I I change my mind occasion and and take critical feedback. But I I don't think anyone who's here would be here if I went on this show and basically said like the Christian whites of America, they're fed up. You know, they're they're just they're going to fight back and drag people out into the streets, just put them up on lampposts, lynch them, all those damned Congress people, the Democrats, all of them. If I was saying that or just unreflectively talking about red pilling people or nationalism is the future or whatever, I might have an audience. I probably would have an audience, but it wouldn't be this audience. And so I do think that the people here recognize that we're going on a critical journey together. We can see ahead, but we don't even quite know where we're going exactly. But that's good. John, do you want to jump in?  Yeah, I missed, I think I missed some of the talk about the Jewish Civil War. But I've heard it floated around for quite a while now that, you know, the catalyst for such an event in Israel would be any attempt to disarm or pacify a lot of the settlers in the West Bank. Now that there is talk of annexing the West Bank, do you think that the IDF will inevitably be forced to do such a thing so they don't have to babysit the settlers in perpetuity? You can take that. I think the settlers are just one of those... It's kind of like Muslims in Michigan or something. It's like this... Ultimately, it's like 5% of the population of Israel, but they are... I mean, they get out to the polls. They're 100% out to the polls because this is...  from their perspective, a matter of life or death. Whereas the Arabs don't vote in Israel. They've given up on voting. And if they voted like settlers, it would be a different political situation. But the settlers have that drive. They are invested. They are activated. And so they punch above their weight. And they're also connected with the Haredi that have their own, again, there are the shahs party um in israel like they go you know united toward judaism all the hereti it's like a it is a biblical commandment like you will get out the vote you will go vote i mean this is in liberals in america will do this educated liberals would be like it is your civic duty you must have i've had so many liberal family members and friends like  Are you voting in this election? You have to vote to save abortion, blah, blah, blah. And that attitude in much of the Western world, the developed world, that attitude is on the left and the right wing. It's always a struggle to drag them to the polls. They don't care, whatever. It's the opposite in Israel. In Israel, the left is totally demoralized. And it's these people like the settlers who are totally activated. So it's a very unique attitude.  dynamic they have going on. One thing I wanted to mention, you said earlier, Richard, about the demographic situation, that projection, I don't think is, or it's becoming less accurate as time goes on, because the Muslim birth rate in Israel has plummeted, and the Heredia have maintained their birth rates, the religious Jews have maintained it, and so We've reached the point now where the Muslim birthright in Israel is lower than the Jewish birthright. And that's because of these Haredi. They just have so many kids that basically the secular Jews or having 1.5 kids or whatever, they outweigh them. And they create this net positive demographic victory for Jews in Israel, which is a... which is kind of an incredible achievement when you look at the rest of the Western world just cannot solve the birth rate problem. You know, Viktor Orban cannot solve it. Vladimir Putin cannot solve it. Xi Jinping cannot solve it. But somehow, you know, the Jews can solve it. Religion can solve it and political policy can't solve it is maybe the lesson there. Right. So that's... I think you mute it. Yeah, I don't know what would happen specifically if the West Bank was taken over, if they would disarm the settlers. But I would say the larger point here isn't so much that the settlers own guns and therefore they're a threat to the state. I mean, God knows how many rednecks own guns in America, and I don't think they're really a threat to the state without an ideology backing that up. I think the problem in Israel and where this civil war dynamic goes forward is the Haredi gain more power, and it becomes more uncomfortable, more unavoidable that you have these people who are in the Israeli cabinet calling for nuclear war, calling for genocide, calling for starvation, and it just becomes more frequent, it becomes a larger percentage, and when those people reach that tipping point, and it doesn't need to be 50%, it could be 30%, but they reach a tipping point in which they define what it means to be an Israeli, and the secular Jews, who have defined Israel from its founding,  Just totally get pushed out. And the question is, do they have a mass exodus? Do they fight back in a civil war? Do they do they give up? Do they convert to Orthodox Judaism, a mass conversion to Orthodox Judaism? I mean, I think that's the really much more interesting question than, you know, how are the how is the military going to deal with gun control in the West Bank or something like that?  Yeah, very strong parallels with the United States as well. I do think 2024 was extremely demoralizing because you could in the first term and in Trump's exile, you could plausibly say that Trump is an aberration and does not represent America.  You know, it we don't know how this happened. We're just going to fight through it. It's like a bad sickness that you just have got to get over. And I the 2024 you just really can't say it that it's like this is who we are. This is America. um the lack of pushback there's some the lack of fundamental pushback on mass deportations and the and televising these things uh in a way the you know even wokeness and i i found wokeness ridiculous and annoying and and etc but  Even the fact that they've given up on it. I saw the Democratic Party endorse the cracker crackle barrel guy or something. You know, the Democratic Party said, we hate the new logo, too, you know, y'all. And I know that's a small issue. seemingly meaningless thing but it actually sort of is a big thing because they've they've given they don't want to talk about transsexuals in sports they don't want to do race bending casting in hollywood anymore they've given up on their own ideology and that that to a very large degree and that is a sign of demoralization  where they are not willing or able to offer a competing paradigm to Trump. And I think that is happening to a very large extent, and I think that is significant.  One thing I would just add to that is that I think there is a phenomenon. There was an article that came out and said, like, Trump's gay White House or something. And so there's a phenomenon where symbolically the left is adopting, like... almost verging on like 1350 posting from like Newsom, they're adopting certain things from the right. They're adopting the Cracker Barrel. But then what the right wing is doing is it's saying our gays are based. So this dynamic is that both sides are kind of stealing from the other in these subversive ways that And you think that, oh, the left is totally demoralized and they're losing and we're going to have a trad revival. But at the same time that, yes, wokeism is dying, but also Christianity is dying at the same time. So it's kind of like mutually assured destruction, but in a decaying way, not in an explosive way. But both sides are kind of falling to attrition and weakening as time goes on. So even though it looks like a victory of Trump right now,  I think the question is, OK, what happens after Trump? And that's when the Republican Party could potentially go through a crisis that mirrors what the Democrats are going through right now. And the end result of that is that trust in both parties goes down. And at some point you hit some kind of floor and things, bad things start happening. I don't know what that.  Because Trump ate the Republican Party. There is no Republican Party outside of Trump. And so when he invariably dies, it is going to suffer a collapse. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true because no one can really replace him. And the attempts to intellectualize Trumpism are cringe. J.D. Vance, National Conservative Convention, it just does not work. It's all about his slop process.  And, yeah. Kyle, do you want to jump in? Yeah. Originally, I was going to ask a different question, but now kind of piggyback off of the last couple of ones. What do you think happens? Like, we're obsessing a lot about, like, what happens after Trump and all that. What happens in a more meaningful way, really, after Netanyahu? Because it seems like, like, given, I mean, I don't believe in everything, like, the Epstein was good. Maybe. Maybe. But really, I mean, the unavoidable fact is that Netanyahu and Likud have exerted an extreme degree of influence over American politics, including, I think, getting Trump back in. And like without Netanyahu, how will that change? Because I could even see him in a weird, perverse way outlasting Trump and even keeping it in advance, you know, given the influence that they've  I mean, I'm just like opening the conference. Like, what do you think will happen then? Yeah, I mean, Trump is undergoing all sorts of decline, physical, cognitive, spiritual. I mean, the guy's talking about going to heaven every day. I mean, he's clearly on the way out. He understands that there are all of these little parasites who are eager to, you know, take the mantle. And J.D. Vance is first among them. And it's like, You get to that point of a certain, like, you know, a Jupiterian wealth where all the people around you, they're sycophants, but you can sense that they're like trying to steal your essence and usurp you. And that is a demoralizing experience. So I think he understands the end is near and he's becoming impotent.  I mean, Netanyahu must be riding high. I mean, this is like the greatest year of his life, basically. I mean, he is going to go down potentially as, you know, the greatest leader of the Jews in 2000 years or more, right? You know, 3000 years since King David, right? So, I mean, that is... um probably on that spiritual level i don't know about netanyahu's personal health but you know that kind of dynamic i think could you know push him forward as a force you know for another decade or something and and maybe xi jinping and and putin and kim will get together and come up with that serum to push him to 150 or something and he'll we'll get another uh you know 10 decades or something god no Yeah, but I will say, adding on to the previous point I made, that the Haredi demographic expansion is very dramatic. And although in this conversation, I've basically blasted and criticized Likud as a force and said everything bad about them possible, I still believe they are not the worst possible force in Israeli politics. It is the Haredi.  And although they are in a coalition with Netanyahu, he is constantly policing them. He is constantly restraining them. He is constantly making compromises that eventually they won't have to make anymore because they'll just win the electoral game. It's not an Arab demographic takeover. It's a Haredi demographic takeover. So when they reach that tipping point, they don't need Netanyahu anymore. And that's very dangerous, because Netanyahu, for all the terrible things I could say about him, he is basically the best leader that Likud could possibly get or deserves or whatever. Because everybody else, you look at all the other people in his cabinet, and they're worse. They're worse than he is. And he's restraining all of them. I mean, there's kind of a similar dynamic with Trump, where it's like, OK, you can criticize Trump to the ends of the earth. But then you look at Stephen Miller and J.D. Vance and all these people surrounding him, and they're worse.  Oh, yeah. Who would want to arrest women for having abortions or whatever? Yeah, all of that would be taking place without Trump as a mediator. And that is analogous to what's going on in Israel. Yeah, absolutely. Philip. Hey, how's it going? You can hear me. You're correct. Yes. So I kind of got in a little bit late on the conversation, so I'll have to go back and listen to it. But kind of touching back on your bio, Joko, is that what you go by? I kind of remember you from, didn't,  Oh, I was just going to say this email address. I didn't even realize I needed to log into Zoom today. So I was like, you know, scampering around to try to. And I realized because I never use this email for anything. And so I was like, oh, there's the old there's the old jokal name. But yeah, I just go by deep left is like a branding exercise of like.  It's these two words. Everyone can remember it. It makes sense. Let's just stick to that. But obviously, I made a mistake here and not changing the username on my end. It's all good. Yeah, now that you mentioned Eric Orwell. Orwell? I do remember seeing a video of you years ago, like walking in the forest with them or something, having some sort of conversation. But didn't you have some collaborations with Trudell Tom years ago? Like you guys did a lot of streams together, correct? In both of those cases, I had very close personal relationships with people that went in totally opposite directions. One person decided...  I'm going to become a 100%. Maybe I was a 50% white nationalist before. Now I'm 100% white nationalist. Or I don't even want to speak on his beliefs. I'm just saying at the time, that's how I felt. And he can disagree, whatever. I'm not here to define who he is. But in the other case, in terms of Trudel Tom, he was just like...  I want to go from 50% or wherever I am to 0%, get the hell out of here. And I knew a lot of people like that because as I was going through that, my transition, and I was like, no, I'm not going to be a coward. I'm not going to run away. I'm not going to say that the world doesn't matter anymore and ideas don't matter.  I'm going to work through this. I'm going to piss everybody off. Everyone's going to hate me, but I'm going to be here. I'm going to continue speaking my mind. And I knew a lot of people who said it's not worth it. You know, everything I believed was a lie. And I just want to live under a rock and get a normal job and never talk about this again. So, you know, and I try not to like. Yeah, it is just it's an intensely it's an intensely personal subject to be like, yeah, these were these were people who were hugely influential beyond. I mean, Eric is a influential person. He's got millions of views and interviews of.  People are talking about him on TikTok of there's this guy starting this white commune. So he's a very influential person. I recognize that when I first saw him in 2014, I said, this guy is handsome, charismatic, and has a forceful personality. He will become the leader of... the right wing in America, the extreme right or whatever, whatever category, alt-right, disser, right, whatever. He's going to become some sort of leader. And I knew that then. And I think I was correct. And, you know, Trudel Tom, like he was extremely influential. And there are so many people who probably to this day are still copying. And I'm not going to name all the people who are copying. Okay. First, I remember Trudel Tom. So he was... he was from australia wasn't he and he was in this sort of yeah reaction i i remember interviewing him a a couple of times and then he just vanished back in like 2018 or something it's been a while now yeah i did a podcast with him and it was like early 2020 and we did a a few episodes and um You know, because it's not just I mean, there's there's the political dimension, the religious dimension. I'm kind of at the point where I don't even see a distinction between the two sociologically and a personal level. If you believe in Christianity and you have a crisis of faith, that is devastating. Even if all your friends in church are like, hey, man, we still love for you. We still are praying for you like that's devastating. And I know people, by the way, it's not just Christianity, people who. who defect from Islam, people who defect from white nationalism, people who defect from, I'm sure there's variants of communism. I remember Curtis Yarvin crying at this Justin Murphy event because he was talking about this poor Stalinist woman who became a Trotskyite and all her friends abandoned her and  And, you know, it's like, yes, that is something that happens. And it is like death. I mean, yes, those people are still alive and they're still living lives. And I wish the best for them on a personal level and their families. And, you know, I want everybody to be happy and I don't want to be like a bitter person of like, oh, why didn't you come with me in my direction in my journey? It's like fundamentally people, you know, the pursuit of truth is a lonely path.  And it doesn't actually win you friends. If you think you're red-pilling people and you're gaining friends at the same time, you're kind of doing something wrong, right? So it's like if you're the actual lone prophet in the wilderness is hated by people, and you do have to be disagreeable, you do have to be antisocial to actually pursue the truth. That's just... one of the facts of reality and you can, you can reject that and you can say, well, I'm not going to pursue the truth anymore, or you can embrace it and say like, okay, my friendships are all going to be sort of strained in this way. And people are going to bring up things from my past and it's going to be uncomfortable. And I'm going to have this weird love, hate relationship with all of these memories. Um, yeah, it's, I don't know what else to say. The last I heard, well, I think Trudeau Tom used to roommate with, he was a roommate with Joel Davis in Australia. I think they knew each other as friends. And the last I heard about him, I remember it was during COVID-19.  He posted a video about needing a job or something, and then he kind of disappeared after that. And I've heard rumors he went to Ukraine. He found work in Ukraine right before the war, and that's when he dropped out. And then supposedly he had to escape Ukraine. wow when the russians attacked so i don't know it would be interesting to hear his story he tried to escape history and history followed him but these are all rumors so i don't know internet stuff sure Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't even feel comfortable speaking on, you know, if somebody wants to be a private person, I just want to respect that. But I will say if we want to talk about e-celeb drama and the personal lives of alt writers, you know, Joel Davis is just such a funny guy to me because I remember he was like...  he had this Jew, Eric Gans, and I forget the other one, but they were like Jewish academics. And he was like, no, bro, if we made Hillary Clinton, the queen, everything would be solved. And I thought it was hilarious. And I thought that whole post liberalism thing was hilarious and fun. And, you know, now he is where he is today. So I just, I just think that I think it's fun. I mean, cause I'm on, I'm not like, obviously if you're invested in the right wing, then you're like,  No, Joel, what are you doing? You're destroying. You're an intelligent person who could be on our side doing good, but you're... And I'm just like, I think it's fun. That's my impression. I'm not invested in the right wing, so he can do whatever he wants. And I'm not really calling him out or anything. But yeah, I remember... I've spoken with Joel Davis on a few occasions. I remember there was one where he was taking Russia's side after the invasion, maybe in 2022.  And but there was earlier he was doing the Gons thing. And I also found that interesting. But I remember him telling me, like, I can't work with you anymore, Richard, because like we we you're too toxic and we need to, like, reach out to the military industrial complex to maintain American hegemony around the world and so on.  And then again, it's like you lose track and they're like, where is he now? And then you see him on your screen just as like an outright national socialist. And it's like, all right, I guess...  Cause I was too toxic for you. Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. I, I think I, I, yeah, like I said, I don't have any, um, I don't have anything personally in there. So I don't, I don't feel, uh, I just, I think there is a place for, I don't know, low cows or, or what's that encyclopedia dramatica or there's various, like, you know, basically Wikipedia ripoffs where it's like, here's every embarrassing detail of this person's life.  Yeah, exactly. Kiwi farms. It's like we can do like a Kiwi farm style podcast where we just go through a litany of individual. But, you know, what I would say to that, the discomfort for me is like, I'm going to have my own entry in that. So it's like, you know, stones and glass houses and whatever. Like, I'm not going to look at any of these people and be like. Oh, and they are just so terrible and so horrible because, I mean, my life is full of embarrassing misadventures and whatever. Totally. Yeah, no, I don't morally denounce people. It is interesting with Fuentes, if you look at Fuentes as a phenomenon, because...  He he recently talked about Joel Davis and he said things that are just objectively true. Basically, you look like assholes that you have a bunch of Australian nationalists doing these anti-immigration protests and you jump up there and you're like, it's really about Hitler, guys. And you're dressed in black. You're leaning into the stereotype.  All of that, I basically agree with. But there are a couple of things. First off, this reminds me quite a bit of the optics wars in 2018. And the most ironic thing about the optics wars is that they were led by Andrew Englund and Weave. So it was the outright... holocaust again not neo-nazis were the ones telling people to get in line you're making us look bad just be a nationalist and so on i uh it it's interesting on a number of different levels but i think it does express the genuinely bad faith quality to that period right after charlottesville where the the entire right was at each other's throats but the other thing about it is that like nick  The Kanye thing was, I mean, look, I'm not a fan of his music. And so I wasn't totally invested in it. And I found it hilarious in many ways. And in some months, some level, Kanye does strike me as interesting. But you were the most outlandish person imaginable. like you out hail trumped me with heil hitler nigga and you know we we love hitler we love everybody but especially hitler while wearing a black mask alex jones is shocked and he's like trying to be reasonable he's like well uh not exactly i mean we're we're rational people here aren't we you know it  I mean, it's weird for him to say these things. It's an odd critique. On a superficial level, I basically agree with his critique, although I'm not going to say it publicly because I don't want to be this hall monitor of the right, and I'm not personally invested in the right anymore. but it's it's just odd for him and i i think maybe fuentes himself is kind of caught between two poles on on one level he deeply wants to go to a trump rally and wave an american flag and just give into it all and and eat it up and say he's the only one fighting israel and and so on and on another level i think nick is drawn towards analysis art even you know with kanye performance art and being radical and in the best ways possible and maybe the worst ways possible as well because there's a thin line separating the crank from the philosopher and and and so on and so i i think he himself it's maybe even like on a daily basis he kind of is is going between these two poles  Yeah, I think you're right. But I also think there's that sort of Dionysian contradiction produces energy. The friction between the two poles produces energy. And I think that's what makes Nick successful. And I think that's what makes... joel less successful is because he's leaned too heavily into no we need to be radical and have principles and this is not fun this is not time for fun the race is going genocide and nick is just like yeah we fucking love nigga hal hitler and it's like there is a self-aware irony that yes i'm gonna do a monologue about how you know, trans people are demonically possessed and, you know, we need to return to religion because we're all going to stand before the judgment seat. And then the next segment is like, he's like, but what if I had a harem of cat boys and Kanye was there and we were like, you know, and we were all, there was like black people marching in Nazi uniforms. Like, wouldn't that be cool and based? And so it's like, The constant inflection between ultimate seriousness and ultimate like nihilistic irony, which Sam Hyde, by the way, also engages in and had that really successful monologue against Elon Musk.  It's like that's what gives Joe Rogan power. That's what gives Ian Carroll power. That's what gives Dave Smith power. This is the age of the comedian. That's what gives Trump power is you can go from the most serious fascist attack on our democracy to he's just a bumbling idiot. He's just a comedian, you know, so that ambiguity.  is kind of the, you know, it's like the trickster God animating. It is Pepe. You know, we've sort of forgotten that figure, but that's what it is. Whereas, you know, the left fails because it becomes too serious. But when the left was the most descendant, it was when it was Bill Maher and Camille Paglia and, you know, these people who were like, you know, Bill Maher was out there and he was politically incorrect was the name of his show.  Yeah, exactly. And it was like, man, these 14 year olds having sex with their teachers, I'm jealous. You know, that's awesome. You know, that spirit, that kind of like nihilistic, you can't really pin me down. It's all just a joke. There's a lot of power in that, that I think the left has lost. It's become super serious. The right wing has it. And every time, but there are these little splinters off the right wing who forget that power. And then they become super serious and then they become lolcows.  Totally agree. We'll do regular guy, and then we might put a bookmark in it. We've been going about three hours or so. Yeah, go for it. I heard Netanyahu functions in a similar way that Tito did during Yugoslavia, the last days of it. And like before his death in 1980 till, you know, the 12-year descendant to the Civil War that right-wingers like to cite as the template for the future race war in America. Is that true that Netanyahu's kind of the glue that holds Israel together? Also, there's a proposed state in the West Bank, a separate Jewish one called, I think it's called the Republic of Judea. where the jewish settlers would actually secede from israel and just finish the palestinians off and create a more jewish jewish state um what's your opinion of that and the plausibility do they do they need to do that with um the lakud tightening their grip over israel that whole um secession proposal it's kind of analogous to ulster third way  The People's Republic of Judea? No, no. Well, it's not the People's Republic. It's like I think the state of Judea. It's like a proposed Jewish state in the West Bank that's not part of Israel, that it's founded by the settlers.  I've never heard of this. Yeah, it sounds like a Monty Python skit. I know it does. You know, I'll believe it when I see it, I guess. I haven't heard of that. I have no reason to believe that. I mean, I'm sure there are settlers who say crazy things, just like if you go to West Virginia and you drive down... an old dirt road and you knock on someone's door and you say hello sir what do you believe they will tell you some batshit crazy insane things that have nothing to do with reality and no bearing or impact on anything in politics and so i think that's basically that the rednecks of israel are the settlers they are a potent force in elections but that doesn't mean that they get everything they want right they they they might um in the way that the the christian evangelicals right they they are pushing forward an agenda that they might not even understand themselves so they are kind of useful idiots in a way and i don't see them as having a lot of agency maybe i'm i'm wrong about that but personally i look at honest thing  A lot of these people are dumb. Frankly, if you look at the guy who killed the prime minister, the assassination, that guy was retarded. The bell curve of Jewish intelligence in Israel is a lot wider than it is in America. I believe it. So when you meet an American Jew and you're like, OK, this is like a consistent I know what I'm getting. You know, I go to McDonald's and I get a hamburger. When you go to Israel, like sometimes you get the prime rib. Sometimes you get shit, basically. So there's just a lot of a lot of crazies. And I don't know. And I think, again, I bring it back to the religious dimension of it's not really about the settlements. If it was secular Jews doing settlements, I would be much more comfortable with that and think it's a much more stable situation than the problem.  is not the fact that Jews are buying real estate in Palestinian territories. The problem is that those Jews are religious fanatics. And so it doesn't matter if they're religious fanatics in Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem or in the Palestinian territories. The problem is that the religious fanatics and that because they are growing  It's going to cause a problem. Now, your first point about Netanyahu being the glue. Yeah, it's true. There is no easy just like there's no easy replacement for Trump. There's no easy replacement for Netanyahu. He's probably got some more longevity. But yeah, we don't know. Anyone could die at any time. um and it's not a parent who would replace him because yeah the cabinet that he has every member of the cabinet you know every other wednesday is threatening to resign because they're so fractured and divided it's a miracle that he can keep that thing together um by a thread and the idea that anyone else is going to be able to do that yeah good luck there's going to be a hung israeli parliament at some point uh and so You have all of the I mean, we've experienced that legislative impasse in America for quite a while now where no party has a supermajority. So nothing gets done. And it's just like, why is health care been an issue for 20 years? Why are we beating a dead horse? And it's just no one could do anything. We don't get a libertarian solution. We don't get a socialist solution. We get the worst of both worlds. And, you know, so when you have that kind of powder keg.  You add to that the religious demographic explosion. Yeah, that's scary. And do you think Israel will just collapse into sheer violence like Yugoslavia or... No, because the thing about Yugoslavia is you had a NATO intervention and you also had Slovenia was just totally out. So it was really, you had Croats, you had Bosnians, you had Serbs.  and Albanians. Those were the four forces. And they were, you know, the three of the four were all against Serbia. They were all working together basically against Serbia. So there was an equal balance. That's what makes the civil war. Civil wars happen when you have approximately a 50-50 split of power. Now, American civil war, you know, Russian civil war, right? There's exceptions to this. But basically, you need some kind of equality of power for a civil war to break out.  In the case of Israel, what are the fault lines? Okay, you've got Jews versus Arabs. Arabs just don't have enough power to force a civil war. They can't do that. Then you could say, well, is it going to be the left versus the right? Is it going to be labor versus Likud? Labor just doesn't have the power to force a civil war at this point. They tried with the judicial reform protests. They got crushed in October 7th, and they're just not coming back. You can look at the opinion polls. So...  There is no potential Arabs versus Jews or left versus right. There's no potential for a civil war within Israel. The bigger question is the model of the Abraham Accords is we pay the Dane Guild. to egypt and to jordan and to saudi arabia and the question is is that as islam enters a crisis of faith not unlike what christianity has experienced over and over again which has led to civil war with you know the english civil war  or the Thirty Years' War and the Holy Roman Empire. When you have a crisis of religious authority, you get civil wars. So the real question is, how do we keep Egypt from exploding, which has a growing population  They're not really turning into a first world country over there. Another parallel to this would be what happened after the partition. You had Bangladesh and Pakistan, which were somehow one country or something. It was a very weird system. And then the Bangladeshis, because their population kept exploding, you had endemic poverty. There was no development.  Eventually, you had a civil war breakout over that, which you could call like a resource war. So I think the problem isn't that Israel is going to collapse due to a civil war internally. I think the internal situation, Israel is...  unfortunately very stable because it's going in this very bad direction with the theocracy. The question is, how do you have an Abraham Accord between Israel and Egypt when the Egyptians are on the threat of a civil war and then the Israelis are like, well, the Bible says we should just nuke them all. We're not going to do diplomacy anymore. And so much of the Abraham Accords is Israel doesn't know how to do diplomacy.  We're doing the diplomacy for them. We're doing the talking for them. It's like, you know, you've got this this brash, brutish, you know, cousin or something. He's always trying to start fights with people. So you go over to the guy he's trying to start and you say, oh, don't mind my cousin. He's you know, he gets a little tempered, but he's really a good guy. Here's fifty dollars. OK, just forget about this whole thing. We don't want to start a fight. You know what happens when America withdraws from the region? Israel is forced to do diplomacy by itself. um yeah and they're becoming increasingly religiously fanatic and like these demographic problems in egypt are getting out of control and like the house of sod is is entering this crisis of faith because on one day they're doing a beheading on the next day they're doing a beyonce concert like you said it's like the qatari wealth yeah everything's great when america pumps cutter full of this oil money What happens when we tariff the world, we withdraw and all of a sudden it's like, you know, whether it's peak oil or there's all sorts of ways that that that, you know, infinite money well could dry up. And that's really scary. Like all it's all dangled. It's all a system of bribery. That's the way the Muslim world works is everyone is being bribed to not be a psychopath.  And the second the money runs out, the psychopathy runs wild. You saw that with ISIS. I mean, it's happened over and over. And it's kind of hard for first world people to understand this because people, I mean, people in Europe went through World War II. And I mean, literally it was like corpses in the streets, bombed out buildings. And you know what they did the next morning? They got their wheelbarrows and they started shoveling rubble.  And they did not stop working the whole way. You know, the Arabs don't do that. When Sodom and Gomorrah, you know, when the fires of heaven come raining down, they just start freaking out. Every time Israel attacks these people, they don't say, okay, we're under attack by Israel. What's our plan? Okay. You know, and I guess you could say Hamas has done that to an extent with these tunnels and things. But that's just not the general part of the reason they're doing that is because they got billions of dollars in funding and whatever. So it's very difficult to imagine the Muslim world successfully like somehow coming up with a substitute for the oil industry, because they don't have infinite oil, somehow coming up with a solution to these demographic problems. You've also got climate change. You've got the fact that Egypt is a desert. It's becoming a worse desert. So if you thought Egypt was dependent on foreign agriculture now, that's just going to get worse and worse. What happens if there's another Ukraine war and now the shipment of Ukrainian grain to Egypt stops? What happens when 10 million Egyptians are starving in the streets?  Yeah, I don't care how much money you bribe the government. That's a really bad situation. So, you know, ideally there would be some sort of, you know, international. We would have some kind of I mean, I believe in USA. I'm just a liberal. I want America to spend money trying to make these people secular feminists to chill out. I mean, Tunisia, I think, is a successful example. Morocco, to an extent. There are examples where western influence can um you know make people chill out and kind of ameliorate this this kettle that's boiling over but if we just cut off the foreign aid and we say no we're not gonna we're not gonna promote that gay shit anymore then yeah i mean it's an explosive situation you can say well it's not our problem well we'll see we'll see if it becomes our problem or not maybe uh maybe some people will be surprised  Well, Deep Left, this was an incredibly enlightening conversation. I'm glad we're back on the same page and that I would love to have you back because we scratched the surface on a number of other issues that we could go into.  So thanks for being here. And definitely, I subscribe to your Substack. And I think everyone else should give it a look at the very least. Just if you search Deep Left on Substack, I believe that's even the URL, deepleft.substack.com, you can find it. You're going to find articles about genociding small dogs and endorsing white genocide and open borders. You're going to find the worst possible. It's basically like gore porn political version. So just be warned, trigger warning.  Yeah, we're here for that. But thanks for being here. We should definitely do this again sooner than later. And I mean that seriously. So it was great having a conversation with you. And thanks for being on. So, all right, guys, I have to wake up early in the morning to get to the kids to school. So I'm going to head on home. But thanks for being here. And I will see you on Sunday. All right. Ciao. Bye.

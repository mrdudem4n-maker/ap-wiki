Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three. Very good. Wow. It's worth every penny, this Shure mic. Do you use a Shure as well? Absolutely. The great standard. It is. You see it everywhere. You rarely see anything else, actually, once someone has sort of gone pro with podcasting.  So, JF, how are you doing? Doing great. Good. Shocking developments in the Candace Owens journalism career. True. She's our source for the truth, in fact.  I'll just mention, I'm not doing too well. I'm sort of recovering from this bug that I've had. I do feel better today, but then I didn't get enough sleep last night, so I don't know if I set myself back. But do you think that COVID is now endemic in the sense that... Because my symptoms...  were a bit of a dry cough, although not a big deal, and fatigue. So I'm sorry I'm going into all this personal stuff. I just wonder if I've caught COVID and it's now so mild that you just have a bit of a brain fog and you're tired, but it's not anything even approaching hospitalization or something. Or the other thought I had was that after COVID, just because of, you know, the mild lockdowns that we had and mask and people avoiding public spaces, et cetera, that I do feel like my immune system was weakened. So I was catching the cold every six weeks after COVID. And I'm usually a bit healthier than that. But I was, you know, I would catch it, have to stay in bed for three days and then be fine and then, you know, repeat, rinse and repeat.  So the other thought that I had is that my immune system is now robust again. And so I actually caught something quite bad, but I'm fighting it off. But I guess this is all just speculation. Definitely COVID is endemic. It has to be endemic. And it's now ignored. It's not tested for anymore. It's part of our everyday. Now, I think that if you have fatigue without much of a cough, it could be blood parasites too. Never forget that we have something like a U.S.-Canadian malaria, an equivalent of the malaria, but it's weaker, and it transmits through bugs. But I have the sickle cell. You have the sickle cell, really? Oh, yeah. Well, people don't know this, but I am. Was there some African-American?  Well, then you should be protected. Another possibility is it's just the season because we have less light, it's getting colder, and you may have a disbalance of electrolytes. I would recommend Centrum for 50+, a good chewing gummy with zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D. Excellent stuff. I will stop by the...  our little organic grocery here and, and pick up some of that. Yes. Some zinc. And then you said Centrum is a multivitamin. Yeah. Centrum multivitamin for 50 plus. It has all of the, all of the necessary stuff. But I'm not over 50. So, I mean, I, I'm not sure. I'm not over 50. I'm 41. And they won't sell it to me. They're like, you're too young. You're also black. Yeah.  Okay. Well, we'll leave it at that. Yeah, no, I am feeling better. It's just been sort of like a week-long allergy thing. Is Kenda Sowens black? That was my question for a few months. Are we being fooled here by an Indian scam artist? That's a very good question because having you noticed that So many of these conservatives and so many also of black people who are successful, they are wearing a mask on some level. You know, people talk about electing Barack Obama in 2008. Isn't this amazing? His middle name is Hussein. And we attacked Saddam Hussein, but five years earlier. And then we elected Hussein.  That is incredible. I mean, it would be like if I mean, we elected Eisenhower in 1950, but it would be like his name was Hitler or something. You know, Dwight Hitler was elected president, which would be remarkable, even if they were, you know, different people.  And something like that occurred with Barack Obama. But, you know, again, Barack Obama is half East African, yet he's sort of presenting himself as an African-American and down with the brothers and knowledgeable of hip hop culture, etc. And I Candace is Jamaican and.  Yes, you're black on some level, but isn't it remarkable that we don't have any actual blacks? That rise to the top, it's almost like. Not being truly African-American, that is West African and raised in America, we we like to neutralize them with something else. Kamala Harris, half Indian, half Jamaican, she is.  Genetically speaking, no connection to the African-American experience. And yet she was going to be our first black female president. God rest her soul. And she exists. Her presidency exists only in the brat imagination.  but it is a funny thing about her. And, you know, I'm sure a lot of people listening to this know this already, but it is worth retelling the Candace Owens origin story, which is just bizarre. And I'll be brief here, but she did first come on the scene. I know everyone fixates on this and maybe blows it out of proportion. It's, you know, it's, it's like saying that Richard Spencer was,  was once a snowboarder in the mid 1990s or something. So he, you know, he listened to Green Day during that period. And this is, you know, we've got to fixate on this. But anyway, she she was creating this doxing website that was seemingly a mechanical Turk. in which you would put in someone's mean tweet or Facebook comment, and it would spit out his home address, which even the left, at least at that point, was like, whoa, obviously that could be misused for violent acts.  So that's where she was coming from. And the left criticized her for that. And then she sort of ran into the arms of Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, who was very influential during this point. And she was sort of the  ex-Democrat Blexit kind of thing of like, I left the left and or did the left leave me? They've gone crazy. She was a pioneer on that sort of anti woke crusade of I don't even understand the Democrats anymore and Republicans just eating it up, loving it.  And so she started out in that area. And I don't know how conspiratorial she would get, but she was fairly conspiratorial. After all, you're talking with Alex Jones, just guilt by association right there. Then she goes to the Daily Wire and... And she gets promoted and she has this friendship with Charlie Kirk, which also from the video she posted, seemed genuine. A weird friendship between a gay Mormon and a Jamaican woman. It's it's true love. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. But She becomes this kind of neocon and this attempt by Ben Shapiro and others to put her up as a golem or as a mouthpiece, as the the black young face of the establishment. And then she marries, along with this, she marries this very strange individual named George Farmer, former CEO of Parler, other things, who is deeply connected with TPUSA, TPUK.  a Catholic Anglo Catholic aristocrat of some kind. And this is just my theory. But he seems to be putting all of these ideas in her head. It strikes me as a kind of bride of Frankenstein situation.  where you have this curious American black woman who sort of can't be criticized. She can't be called racist. She can't be called reactionary or a Catholic traditionalist or an aristocrat. And you start putting all these ideas in her mind, the Frankist, you know, the Khazar theory of the Jews. They're not really Jews. And other things, Hitler was okay when he... kept it within germany which germ which jews took as like in some ways is even worse than like promoting hitler because what he did internally was like  crack down on on on Jews and put them into camp. So anyway, she seems to be fed these ideas and then she gets kicked out of the Daily Wire. She she goes after Israel in a powerful and genuine manner. I'll just be kind of fair here. And and then now she has this show, which is the number one YouTube show for politics and culture. She's blowing away CNN. She's blowing away maybe even Joe Rogan. I don't know. She's being very popular. And I listened to about 15 minutes of it. It was like it was like I was back in Monroe, Louisiana with my the friends of my grandmother. It's just these like gossipy women at the beauty parlor. um just sort of talking about nothing and insinuating like that pastor well he says that he's doing good but is he really doing good like i don't know about this past like just this assertion insinuation of of all sorts of things and she's she's no doubt maintained the audience of like Alex Jones types, but I think she's expanded her audience into suburban white women in an Oprah Winfrey-like fashion.  of this is our black lady. These white women in the suburbs, they love it when black women just talk, talk, talk, talk. They just can't get enough of that. And she's just a rip-roaring success. She's sort of unstoppable. I think she's completely batty and insane, but I'm not her audience. So anyway, that was a way of just setting up the whole thing.  Absolutely. Beautiful description of the history. I've come to like her in the last few days. I've been critical of hers because precisely of what you mentioned, you cannot do good journalism and mix it in with 99% crap conspiracy theories. You can't talk about the trap door under Charlie Kirk while also seriously raising serious question of will the investigation be properly done on potential political links to Israel with Tyler Robinson. The thing is the mix of it removes credibility. The mix of it loses and her handling of evidence is weak sometimes it is misinterpretation of evidence sometimes it is misinterpretation of sentences but you have to give it to her though she has waited up to October 6th to publish her strongest evidence and I believe she's playing numbers here I believe she is she has so much poison in her heart She has so much poison in her heart, she wants to throw the message to Israel, I'm going to miss your October 7th celebration. I'm going to miss it with facts. Interesting. Now, you have to imagine how much restraint it takes for someone who wants popularity, who has the greatest show on YouTube, to be withholding that evidence, which I was frustrated by. But yesterday, I understood it all. She wanted to hit Israel in the testicles.  And she did it. She did it in such a poisonous way that a man like mine cannot even conceive of this kind of dirty warmongering. I mean, there were even co-hosts of Tim Cast's Sour Patch Lids crying almost on her Twitter saying, I can't believe she does that the day the 1,200 Jews died. Unbelievable. Yeah.  Well, 1,200 Jews cried on October 7th, 2025. That is true. Let's listen to this. And then there's actually another shoe to drop. I don't know if you've seen this, but TPUSA responded. So I'll play that as well. But this is almost three minutes. She doesn't quite get to the point, but she has a rambling style that's very popular with Shelly. who lives in a suburb of dallas texas but rob in particular knew for an absolute fact that charlie was done with israel bullying him that's what bothers me so much about this man him allowing these headlines charlie's pastor speaks out you know crushes candace because of what she said not whatever i don't like it he knew  And others knew that Charlie was done with the issue of bullying him. And I am now going to present you proof of what I am saying. This is an actual group chat, which happened two days before Charlie Kirk was assassinated. There were nine people in total on this chat. including charlie uh and rob mccoy i'm going to protect the names of the other seven for now to be clear i might actually release a name every day this week but i want to show you this because suffice it to say this is like literally the batman halloween where well the long halloween in the batman comics she says i might release one name of them every day for seven days  She's playing with Jewish teams, October 7th, the Seven Candles. She's into some wicked stuff. This is witchery of the highest level. This is witchery with a million viewers on YouTube. Yes, until they reveal the identity of the Batman. I mean, she will continue. time rob mccoy was on this text thread and i think it helps contextualize him as a person in my view that he would attack me for telling the truth about the pressure that he was facing take a look so charlie writes in this group chat just lost another huge jewish donor uh two million a year because we won't cancel tucker i'm thinking of inviting candace somebody writes oh  Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause. And somebody writes, Sedona writes, please do not invite Candace. That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term, in my opinion. Like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions. That nasty free will thing that God bestowed on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.  So again, this is 48 hours before Charles was assassinated. He was very clear and he was very excited. That nasty free will thing that allows us to criticize Israel on occasion. Let me read these again here. I'll just go back to them.  I think it is important to sort of like dive in. There is much in there. Just lost another huge Jewish donor.  $2 million a year because we won't cancel Tucker. Interesting. I'm thinking of inviting Candace. So that almost seems like he's being aggressive or something now. He's like, oh, well, I'm going to invite. Yeah, like if you do this, I'm going further. They said, ugh, Jewish donors play into all the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this.  leaving me no choice just to leave the pro-Israel cause. Just the stereotype comment here is fascinating because he's saying, he's making the realization that anyone on the so-called far right would have, which is, I try to extend discussion with these Jews. They come at me with cognitively dissonant talking points.  They seem to lie to my face. They seem to cancel me. Every time I see a Jew, it's for having a piece written about me. Every time I see a Christian, it's to buy beef and eggs from his farm. And he has realized when I interact with Jews, it's different. Yes. Do you think he might have been sarcastic when he said, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause?  I think the sarcasm is potentially possible, but I don't think it's not my main explanation. When he says this, what I think he means is he wouldn't even want to be against Israel. And in fact, leaving the pro-Israel cause doesn't mean going after Israel, doesn't mean being negative. Doesn't mean entering the anti-Israel cause, right, yes. I think that what's going on in his mind when he says this, and I've been reflecting about this yesterday. Here's what goes on. He is being bullied. He does not want to be under extortion. Therefore, he has to withdraw from the extortion, withdraw from the bullying. But he is receiving money from people who expect him to submit himself to bullying. And so in his moral mind,  He says, I cannot continue selling myself. I cannot continue accepting your money because you expect a service from me that I cannot deliver. Therefore, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause because you are sending me money on which you have expectations that I cannot deliver on. And therefore, it's a deceptive relationship. I cannot do the deceptive market. That is what he means. It's actually no comment about Israel so much, but the impossibility that has been created for him to continue in the economic relationship as it stands. A couple of things here. First off...  This doesn't paint Charlie in a good light, even if you are anti-Zionist. Because it's striking how, at least ostensibly, at first glance, how mercenary he is. Could someone have given him $2 million a year and he's going to be...  pro-Nambla or something, or he's going to be a vegetarian activist. I mean, I don't know. So it is a weird light in which he's painted. Now, this is such a short snippet, you could certainly find text messages of mine that make me look completely horrible, and I wouldn't want to be just judged on that one instance. So putting that aside, but nevertheless, there is some tension here.  The other thing that that comes to mind is. You know, in some ways. Charlie Kirk is being self-aware, but not fully. What I mean by this is that. Charlie Kirk.  is a kind of Goldilocks figure. He's not too bright, but not too dumb, just right. He's not too handsome, but not really that ugly. He's just right. And he's not too charismatic, but not uncharismatic.  Just right. And he that's who he is. He's he has no education outside of a high school education in which during recess or when other kids are playing sports, he was listening to Rush Limbaugh.  He's kind of, as someone put it, like skinny fat. He doesn't work out or play sports because he's just constantly podcasting or constantly reading the news or talking to someone in the conservative movement cause. And so he's a golem. Like, Charlie, I don't want you to be assassinated, but...  The kind of deification that we have seen over the past two weeks is absurd. He's not terribly interesting. I mean, is he that brave? OK, but we forget how many like millions of dollars were put behind his campus tours. You know, it's not like he was just going out on under some beach in California, hopping on a soapbox and talking about Jesus. He was doing highly choreographed, well-funded junkets, basically, you know, in these colleges.  And so I'm not quite sure how brave he is. And it's like he's a golem. I'll just be brutally frank here. And I'm painting with too broad a stroke. He's a golem of the Jews.  who became self-aware at some point, but not fully self-aware. Like you, Charlie, I get it. I don't want to be bullied either. I get it. And in some ways I respect the resistance and pushback you're putting up there. But... You're just some dude working middle management at Target if you hadn't been somewhat haphazardly randomly chosen by the Jews. I mean, a little bit. It's too broad a brush. But if the Jews hadn't decided that you were going to be their golem during the Trump era, like that's why you exist. You're not great.  You're not terribly interesting, to be frank. You're good at fundraising and pressing the flesh. I'll give you that. But your flesh was pressed by them, mostly. Like, you were chosen as their mascot for the football game that's going on. And you seem to have some illusion that, like... You're playing the game like he's like in a tiger costume by the stand, like the grandstands going like, you know, go team, go team. And he seems to believe that he's the quarterback. You're not the quarterback. You're a golem. You're a mascot that they created for their purposes to for electioneering and winning over the crowd. That's who you are. exactly and and he doesn't seem to be aware of that like he almost believes he's high in his own supply he believes his own nonsense so that was the other now this is the other thing i'm using the golem metaphor the end of the golem story is that they shut down the golem and that is what candace owens is implying and to be honest it does sort of fit the script now  Does that mean Israel killed him? I'm not at all ready to say that. But it is interesting how there is that little embedded story of they invent this goofy, cute, fairly intelligent little white boy mascot for the Republican Party and Israel, and then he gets shut down. That's the script, and it sort of fits, but... Absolutely, and everything you say there is exactly why it's a massively plausible explanation to think that there may have been Israeli terrorists getting rid of him because he's a golem, because he's nothing, and because if he's nothing, he's not worth keeping alive, and yet by staying alive, he may become someone. One thing I've learned interacting with Jewish power, with my own interactions with Jeff Epstein,  They hate it when you promote yourself instead of the institution you're building. Because the institution is available to take over. You are not available to take over. And you may drift toward an anti-Israel stance later, but the institution, they want to keep it for themselves.  And I've been denying myself some funding from Jeff Epstein at some point. I remember sitting in New York in a cafe with his assistant, and she was like, Jeff is alarmed at the fact that you self-promote too much. We want you to promote NeuroTV as a philosophical show. We don't want you to put...  the philosophers and the neuroscientists forward. We want you to put the show forward so eventually we can take it. That was the kind of underlying message. And I said, you know what? Back then it was 2014.  I said it's 2014. The social media is developing such that it's all about individuals and how much trust they gain with the audience. The future is without institution. The future is without CBS, ABC News. And you will only have men that you can count on your team or not on your teammates. And if the condition of Jeff for giving me more money for my show is that I have to put this aside, I'm not doing it. I'm going to write on my own. So in a way, I've done my own Charlie Kirk moment in 2014. Charlie Kirk did it in that Telegram message where he said even more explicitly than I did then, I'm going to have to give up the pro-Israel cause. Thank God I didn't get shot. but definitely it has changed my relationship with Jeff Epstein at that moment when I said these words. I know this is self-serving of me to say, and I'm aware of that, but just go with it. I obviously engage in self-promotion. Now, I also... collab with people whom I respect and I learn from, we disagree, we move thought forward, et cetera. I'm a very willing conversation partner, but I am obviously self-promoting and I obviously think for myself, the thing that people hate is that I'm contrarian or he's a liberal or whatever. All that means is that I'm not on the team.  And I do feel like I am more of a threat because of that than other people. And again, I'm not just engaging in self-flattery here. There are people in Charlie Kirk's orbit. I remember the Blake Neff character who was in Charlie Kirk's orbit who got sort of mini-canceled in  in 2018-ish for going on chat forums and blowing up, you know, being Hitler-y, basically. And all of those people have, in a way, said things that are more outrageous or said things that are equally outrageous that I've said on a larger platform. Yeah. you know, like MLK was a sex fiend and, you know, the, which I don't even bother talking about it. I think that's irrelevant. Maybe he was such a good activist precisely because his libido was so large. That's probably the argument that I would make. But anyway, or we shouldn't have done the civil rights act. Did you know that 13% of the population commit 50% of the credit, et cetera. They've done all of those things, all that sort of like basic bitch work. alt-right 2015 level stuff they've all done the difference is they're all sort of interchangeable nerds cogs in the gop mega machine and so they're operating on behalf of the team i'm not  I want to go after I don't want the team to win. So I'm like, I'm an open enemy of them, but they can sort of get away with it. And that's why we're in this like bizarre place where  They won't talk to you, me. Nick Fuentes, they'll sort of footsie under the table a little bit more, but they won't talk to him, and I don't think they will, precisely because he is his own person who can go north, he can go south, he can go east and he's west. Not that he's random, it's that... he can think for himself he possesses that ability and they don't like that they want to trot out 1350 when the the group hive mind decides that that's the time to trot this out and they want to pull it back in when they when they're you know endorsing herschel walker for senate or whatever the hell they're doing  So if you don't operate in their little hive, they hate you. They think you're anathema. You have cooties. They think you're a radical extremist. Even though I would... suggest that like just based on the level of like superficial salaciousness, the conservative movement is more right wing than I am or you are. Like if you want to get just like crude racism or like personal attacks against AOC or whatever, you should go there. You shouldn't subscribe to me. You're not going to get that stuff from me.  So, you know, ostensibly superficially, they are more like lunatic than I am. Yet I'm the lunatic in their mind. It's just a very interesting phenomenon that's worth dwelling upon.  Yeah, I think there's been a huge split in the last 10 years of cognitive freedom. And there's just a bunch of people who have, and it's probably the default social mode of humanity to reject black sheep. And, you know, you have these whole stories of scientists getting thrown down.  the roofs and people being eliminated just because they were ahead of their time. And yeah, they really don't like free thought. They will all pause for it. They will all say a couple of lip service to free market of IDs. But in reality, there's very few people that truly have the pursuit of free thought for individuals away from any social pressure. Not many people are made of that cloth.  I agree. AA, do you want to... Let me do this, AA. I'm just going to play one more thing here. This is a brief one. But this is...  And then I'll get to your question. This actually is confirmation that this text message is in fact real, which I certainly questioned. That weird like Dairy Queen photo that Candace released that had Superman paraphernalia. Superman came out in July and it was a Tyler Robinson. I don't know what to say, but this has at least been confirmed by someone whose interest it might be to reject it and claim that it's lies. So that's very interesting, but I'll just play this. But I want to take the start of this show to address some of the things that have been going around on public, namely about a text, a group text chain that has been made known and released by Candace Owens. And I just want to address it head on because, you know, that was a text grab, a screen grab that I had shared.  with people. So it is authentic. And I want to go into it because I actually am really excited that the truth is out there. I first want to say the reason I didn't share that screen grab publicly is because it was a private exchange. And I felt like it didn't necessarily comport with things that were already public. I wanted to not betray my friend's trust in that way.  But I did share it with some people in government because it happened really quick. It took 33 hours for authorities to get their suspect. And in those first moments, we wanted no stone unturned. We wanted to leave nothing unturned. So I shared it with a few people. Don't know where it went from there, apparently. But here we are. One of the reasons, Blake, that I'm glad to have this now public, it was not mine to share publicly, but one of the criticisms we've received is that we don't... It's like the least charismatic man ever. Anyway, this is Blake. He doesn't say much more than this, but this is very interesting because he... Oh, hold on. I'm stuck on that.  Let me try to stop. There we go. OK, there we go. It's very interesting because what he's suggesting is that he gave those things to the government, I would presume the FBI, who were investigating the case. And I don't know, maybe he even himself had some questions. That's curious that he would give them that screenshot, because otherwise that screenshot is unresponsive, irrelevant to Charlie Kirk's assassination. Maybe he gave him a whole bunch of screenshots over the past week or something. Who knows? But what he's suggesting is that  That someone in the government gave that to Candace Owens. So Candace Owens was not in that discussion. So there's a leaker at the FBI, which is sort of fascinating.  That is one thing that's fascinating. Another thing that's fascinating with this segment is they are less interested at getting to the public truth than Candace is. It's very clear that Candace wants to push for these to be known. They're kind of uncomfortable about it. They're happy it did happen, but they wouldn't have done it themselves. So TPUSA, it's still on the fence to me whether there are internal forces within TPUSA that wouldn't want the truth to be found. And that is kind of worrying in and of itself. Also, I would note there may be some degree of laundering of action here where someone who has committed something kind of wrong or kind of unethical is trying to wash it away by a small comment. And here you mentioned that, yes, he says eventually, I gave it to the government. But the first sentence that he says, he says, I may have given it to a couple of people.  Now, that to me, there is a difference here. Yes, you did give it to the government after Charlie Kirk was murdered. But did you share those screenshots? Or are you aware that some people in that group chat exchanged those screenshots before the death of Charlie Kirk? And given the laundering type of talk that he does, I may have given it to some people and then eventually confirmed, well, I gave it to some people in the government. I think there may be a larger umbrella of people who knew about this discussion.  And there's also people are pointing out Josh Hammer today. Josh Hammer tweeted a very bizarre tweet between the moment this telegram conversation happened and the killing of Charlie Kirk. He went to an old Donald Trump tweet from 12 years ago that was talking about public executions. And he tweeted, based. Now, people are saying this is in line with Irina, the murder of Irina, and perhaps he was calling for public executions of the murder of Irina. But it's very, very weird to me that he's talking about public executions all of a sudden on his Twitter account.  after having seen Charlie Kirk detaching from the pro-Israeli cause. So what I'm wondering here is, will there be proper police work in finding the extent to which this conversation has spread before the murder of Charlie Kirk?  because there are organizational people who may have had financial interests. There are even people who may not be directly related to Israeli interests, may have seen this as a foreboding of perhaps them losing their jobs within TPUSA, perhaps them losing funding, losing opportunities. So there is a large umbrella of hypotheses that rise from  the disclosure of Candace Owens, which doesn't seem to put TPUSA in much comfort. That was a good catch. AA, you have a question or comment? Yeah. Hi, Richard. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. So something was mentioned earlier about how basically the TPUSA thing is astroturfed.  And Charlie Kirk is basically an agent of who's ever funding his operation. And it's interesting because the reactionary mind, and by that I mean conservatives mostly, but other reactionaries, fascists, et cetera, really do, I mean, first of all, they lack any kind of creativity because authoritarianism and creativity can't go together. They are diametrically opposed to each other. But they also have a sort of grievance politics. And, you know, we're aware of the Southern strategy, but it goes beyond that. It's a, the elites are against us, a sort of populism. And I think Fran Lebowitz put it perfectly she said you know um when liberals think of elites they think of the wealthy when conservatives think of elites they think of the educated um and yes that's true it's 100 true um and the conservative grievance often is we're the real america we're not accepted this kind of thing and the reason for that is that they  can do all the politicking they want. They can engage in all the legislative action they want. And they're very good at it. Pat Buchanan was right. Conservatives are very good at electioneering. They're very bad at governing, but they're very good at electioneering getting their laws passed. Terrible laws, but they're very good at it. What they are not good at and have never been good at and will never be accepted at doing is culture. They've never been accepted by the culture. Hollywood would sort of bend over backwards to sort of noble savage, the Southerner, but it just doesn't work. The only culture they produce is explicitly conservative culture. Liberals don't do this. They might do a little bit of, you know, get out type movies that critique liberals, but most of the time that's not really political. It's much more esoteric and it's much better just generally. And so their grievance goes beyond the,  you know, we don't have, I don't know, white people are being, you know, trod upon or whatever. It's really that the culture doesn't like us. And of course it doesn't because they have no culture. They're uncreative, authoritarian weirdos. And you can see this with TPUSA. It's all just, you must vote for us. But what happens after that? I mean, presumably if they got into power,  I don't want to go all Handmaid's Tale, but it would be like that. I don't know if you've seen the series, but it's basically just drab and bland and everything's gray on gray. And there's just nothing to it. Their culture is go to church and get married. And that's obviously a fairly benign statement. But if they were to implement that as policy, I think the liberals are correct that it would... somewhat resemble a handmaid's tale of their culture is anti-culture, like their culture is stop thinking about culture and go to church, which I don't even know what they get from church. They clearly don't understand the message of Jesus in the slightest bit. So they just go to church as like a chore.  basically, and then you get married also as a chore. It's like, don't have fun. Yes. And I mean, isn't right-wing Christianity using religion as a way to push what you already wanted? And by that, I mean, if you look at, for example, the religious aristocrats of the past, none of them were Christian in their actions.  They were all whoring around and raping and pillaging and et cetera, et cetera. But it was used as a cudgel against the peasants to say, if you were slave, pick the cotton faster and you'll get to heaven. It was that kind of thing. And it's similar with conservatives. It's like the Bob Jones University type stuff, segregation scriptural. Just find any  lawyer yourself into what you already want. Use Christianity to your own ends. Don't look at the actual message, which is that Jesus is a social justice warrior. Communism, egalitarianism. I mean, J.D. Vance, I'm sure you remember this, but he was talking about To be a Christian is to love your family, then to love your neighborhood, then to love your country, and then to love everyone else. So we shouldn't care about illegal aliens. And Jesus' message is the opposite. I mean, what is the Good Samaritan story other than strangers are your neighbors?  Yes. Also, the platonic impulse at the very heart of Christianity is there must be a good and there must be justice outside of me and my friends when my enemies lose. That's literally the jumping off point for platonic philosophy is it's not just about winning and losing friend and enemy. There actually is a higher justice, a higher good.  And the idea that J.D. Vance... It's just absurd on its face, in a way, to say that Christianity teaches you to love your family. It's like, no shit. Of course you love your children. Do you need Jesus to tell you to love your children? He tells you to do the opposite, to hate your father and your father. Right. He comes...  He who doesn't hate his mother and father cannot follow me. Radical little bits in his sermon. He comes to divide people on the basis of, are you absolutely dedicated to my message and cause of universal brotherhood and love? Or are you trapped in the past?  You know, that's what he's saying. And so it's like it would be almost like Jesus, like, as Jesus said, you should breathe. Just constantly be breathing. Like, you know, it's like as if someone needs to tell you that or as if that's some bold new worldview that breathing is good.  It's exactly as you say. They take what they want, and then they sort of find it vaguely in some text that they barely understand. Yes. Yes. And, I mean, you said this perfectly. When we were talking one time, you said, you know, they are the Pharisees.  If they were alive at that time, they would have killed Christ. This guy, he's against law and order. He's upsetting things. He's trying to do things differently. They hate all that. They have no creativity, and they just want to stomp on anything that is even remotely interesting. Yes. They would have killed Jesus. Yes.  The state has a right to defend itself. I say that with no hesitation. Anyone who presented himself as God in the form of man who is preaching a new age of universal love, they would shoot that bastard. It's just who they are.  Yet they worship him after the fact. But Jesus, have you ever read Carl Schmitt? Right. Have you ever heard of the friend-enemy distinction? God. They are just terrible. OK. So, JF, is there... So what do you think is going to happen here? I mean, to go back to the Candace situation and the assassination situation, I find the notion that Tyler Robinson killed Charlie Kirk on behalf of his lover, I find that plausible, actually. So... At the same time, discussion of the entry and lack of exit wound, what gun was used, et cetera, this discussion is metastasizing on YouTube and et cetera. And I'll just be honest here, just because I keep an open mind, I haven't come to any sort of conclusion. I find a lot of it fairly compelling. So what are your thoughts on sort of  where this is going or is the, might this tear the conservative movement apart? They had this just moment of total unity with Charlie Kirk's death. Amazing unity. And might the sort of aftermath of this tear them apart? If it does, I'm happy because I think it's ultimately, there's not even a conservative thinker today.  Everyone is a nefarist selling something to someone. And Brian Hollihan rising, you know, what is this guy about? He's for immigration, apparently, for Israel. So what is conservatism at this point? But what Charlie Kirk made of it, which is it's an operation at getting you to vote Republican.  which is a thing in and of itself, but it's not an intellectual pursuit. My big worry about the developments is that things will fizzle out and that we will be left with the plausible story that you mentioned. Personally, the whole bullet wounds, all of the parallel stuff, I think all of it is weak. I'm personally leaving it behind until it's supported by something more strong. Personally, my working hypothesis is Tyler Robinson shot Charlie Kirk in the neck from the front from a roof for his boyfriend. But then this is where I'd like to see deeper police work because there's a way he could have done it for his boyfriend in ways that we yet have to understand.  Because it's one thing to say I'm killing a fascist for my boyfriend. It's another thing if he was put up to this idea by ideological influence. It's another thing if he was promised Bitcoin if he would shut up. It's another thing if under the keyboard that he left the message that he left to his boyfriend.  where there are Bitcoin keys with that message. It's very bizarre that it's the first thing that he said in the text message, go right now under my keyboard and take what's under it. And we are supposed to believe that under that keyboard was only a message that says, I just killed Charlie Kirk. I think that there should be work. And it's been destroyed. Yeah. And Lance Twig sees that message and burns it, but takes a picture of it before burning it.  Was there a metal plate with that message? Was there some money transfer happening here? I think we're being pled on so many fronts, but at the same time, the people who question, they question so large and so broad that all of their branches of investigation are unproductive. I would like a productive...  branch of investigation. And with Candace revealing, what we have is the beginning of, okay, let's try to figure out who were the people meeting with Lance Twiggs and Tyler Robinson in the last month and who were the people in that telegram chat. And is there any link? Is there one that's the cousin of another or they hung out or they were seen at a bar? Any connection between these two groups is right now what should the police pay attention to? Yes.  Yeah, I co-signed that. Let's move on to... I have two other topics that I hope we can discuss, and maybe we'll do 30 minutes apiece here. One of them is Taylor Swift, which is an interesting one. I'll save that, and I'll just talk about where we are right now in terms of  the government shutdown, the ICE raids, the expansion of ICE to be this large fighting force. I actually spoke to someone this morning, and she is a journalist, and she was saying that some people were telling her to go, you need a report on Patriot Front and whatever. And she was like...  Why would anyone join Patriot Front when you can join ICE and get a pension? In the sense that something like the alt-right back in the day, Patriot Front continued up to this day. It's this sort of LARP of a paramilitary organization.  You know, that's actually nonviolent. In fact, it's just marching around with shields and flags and, you know, hip, hip, hooray, whatever. Why would you want to reenact what a paramilitary organization would be like when an actual government sanctioned paramilitary organization is hiring?  And they allow you to beat up Browns like in they'll actually cover for you. Apparently there's a weird situation here with like a body cam that's not being shown in court or whatever. Like, why? What is the point of all this stuff? Like, what is the point of Patriot Front when like the posters have taken over government? And look, I know I might sound like a liberal hysteric saying this, but this seems to actually be happening and open talk about going into cities like Chicago.  They are now openly going into Portland. They are already in Washington, D.C. They have met some resistance, but not definitive resistance. And I actually personally think that Illinois will just let them in at some point and that the resistance will be weak. There's also notions with the government shutdown.  You have this vote character from the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025. Might they be using the shutdown as an excuse to do the whole unitary executive thing and start eliminating agencies where Doge failed because it was too outrageous? It was too focused on Elon Musk and his own narcissism. Now they're just going to do it with all of these boring conservative characters who are going to do it behind the scenes. This is something, again, liberals are fearing, and I wonder if their fears are correct. There is also a very interesting memo going around about let me just get the actual title of it here. Yeah. In SPM seven. which is this memo on the dangers of terrorism and insurrection in the United States that is very vaguely defined as anti-American activity. So I'm setting this up here of...  Maybe we actually are living through a sort of conservative fascist coup. I mean, might we be? Is it too hysterical? Yeah. So where do you come down on this, JF? Well, I mean...  Yes, yes, they are behaving very weirdly. Trump and his administration, they are behaving in a way that I thought America was done with this. I thought we were a nation of due process, and they can step over it when they get tired, apparently. I don't know what to think. I'm not sure that the shutdown will turn so positive as to destroy the American government or parts of them. Because in the past, shutdowns have just been occasions for bureaucrats to accumulate salary and they get a full check at the end of it, reimbursing them for all the hours they haven't worked. So I don't have much hope in the shutdown. Now, if it is a hidden occasion for Project 2025 people to reform the government, then I'm happy about it. As far as ICE and the militias, I think there is still a place for the cognitive weirdos out there who don't like the state. And they want a militia that is formed by the people. And to them, anything that the state does will be subservient to its own interest or to corporate interest.  So I think there is a place for something like Patriot Front, but of course it's a minority. And yes, you're right, the offer that the state has for people is much more interesting. But what we have is still a growth of the state, a growth of the attacks on individual rights, a growth on the attacks on due process. Even the immigrants don't appear to have due process anymore.  So that's where we are at. And yes, to credit the left, it does look like the rise of Hitler. Orange Hitler. Yeah. What do you think it is? I remember tweeting back during January 6th And or maybe it was maybe it was after the election of 2020 when I had fully gone against Trump. This man is buffoonish and incompetent. The Trump movement is deranged and stupid. I was just totally out.  At that point. And I remember saying these things because there was all this hot talk like they can't take our elections away from us like they can't take away our president. It's all this hot talk. And I was like, even if Donald Trump were to install himself as president and be just a dictator, it would look like.  it would be identical to what we just saw from 2017 through 2020. He would be battling with the media. The bureaucrats would refuse to build the wall, and then he would cave. He would say stuff about getting trans people out of the military on Twitter, and people would hoot and holler, and then what does this even mean? Basically, I was saying there's no ideological drive. Like, I don't...  They're like, to quote the Joker, they're like a dog chasing after the postal truck. They wouldn't know what to do with it if they actually caught it. Do you think that that's still in effect? Because Trump 2025 ongoing...  they have the benefit of the redo. You know, it's like they got up to bat and the pitcher threw them three sliders and they struck out. And then they're like, okay, let's do that again. Throw the same three pitches this time.  And lo and behold, they're making contact. So they've had the benefit of a redo. And they are being much, much more successful. And in some ways, just much more open and ruthless about it. But I think the problem still remains. What does conservative fascism look like?  What is it? We get rid of the bureaucratic state, deconstruct the administrative state, in the words of Steve Bannon. Okay, you get rid of these bureaucrats who I basically agree are just sort of rent-seeking people. people who just serve their time and get their pension and wokeness has no doubt suffered a a body blow that it might not even recover from it it's viewed now as cringe the woke are on their heels there's no doubt about that but regardless what is it what what does this look like You know, is there a there there to conservatism, which does seem to be this sort of negative ideology that since the 70s, at the very least, has been pushing back at liberal advances? You know, say no to the ERA. No, we don't like that. Oh, feminism? Well, you know, sure, women should earn the same as men, but don't do this legislation. We don't quite like that. Gay rights? Woo, we hate the gay rights. Oh, well, ugh.  Might they get married? OK, but no trans, no trans this time. You know, that's been the dynamic. It's been this. The left takes three steps forward and the right takes maybe one step backwards. But you've already covered all of this ground. The revolution has taken place. But I don't know, even if if they are able to enact Trump fascism, what does it mean?  Are we anti-American, according to this latest memo? I mean, that's a small question. I don't I'll survive, but I won't burn the flag. I promise not to. But but what is it? What are your thoughts on this?  I mean, you're putting your finger on it. I don't have much to add. There's a taste of unsatisfaction to all of it. And it's like, yeah, I think we might have reached Trump fascism. And yet, Trump fascism is very painful for the guy that's on the Venezuelan boat that gets blown up by a missile. Trump fascism is very painful for the woman with three children in a Palestinian apartment in Gaza. Trump fascism really sucks if you happen to wear a tattoo of a gang sign on your knuckles and you're an illegal migrant in the U.S. Yeah.  For me, it doesn't suck all that much, and I don't feel much of the difference. And I'm sure for most people, it's not much of a difference. So that's what it is. And when you thought, what is the project? Well, it seems that the project is anti-woke in general. So it's the whole idea that we will have female sports. that we won't have trans going into the female category, that we will basically restore the heterosexual order of the world. It's kind of what it looks like. It looks like under a Trump fascism, let's say in 10 years from now, with all of this playing out, the gay community is kind of back to being a secret paraphilia of sex of some kind that is to be regarded as out there. And that's kind of good, but it still feels like very small, given the intensity of what the left has been capable of pulling since the 1960s. It all feels very unsatisfying. Yes, I completely agree. I wonder also the degree to which America can really project power in the world without liberalism.  You know, the idea of... Very interesting. Well, you know, what has been more powerful, an American military base in Germany or an American movie theater in Germany? What was more powerful? Now, it's a rhetorical question. I might even come down on the side of, yeah, the nukes, that was more powerful than the movie theater. But the fact that you can ask that question is interesting.  And Americanism was deeply popular. All of those pride flags at American embassies, that wasn't just some woke moron expressing her predilection. That is sort of the ideology of the American empire, of leave all that... corrupt, communist, trad, stodgy, dusty stuff behind and get with the times, have fun, meet a girl, make money, move to the West. Get the vaccine. Get the vaccine. Great. Yes. But that's what...  It is. That is a compelling argument. If the American empire's force projection is, we hate you, motherfuckers. We're going to tariff your product or anything you produce, regardless of whether we could even conceivably build it here.  get away from us. You might come here on a tourist visa and we'll rip you out of your hotel room naked and drag you down the street and throw you into a prison in El Salvador. I mean, look, I'm exaggerating, but not by much. And I'm exaggerating to make a point, which is that that's obviously terrifying and extremely unattractive. So this is conservatives will constantly tell themselves like the liberals are damaging American power or something. I think the reverse is true. Like this is not an attractive offer to the world. that we are now presenting and I I don't know at some point the cracks in the American Empire are are going to become fissures and they're going to become canyons and it's going to come crashing down because the American Empire is built on credibility credit legitimacy desire that's what it's built on just as much as it's built on nuclear weapons  Very strong. I agree. But, I mean, this is American isolationism. There are pros and cons. Maybe isolationism, of the kind that is being practiced by Trump, is an overreaction to a cognitive dissonance. Because, ultimately, you could have preserved American demographics by just cutting immigration. But it seems we can't get there. And so, instead, we become super fascist and we...  crack down hard on anyone we can catch as an illegal migrant. But the reality is you just had to scale down legal immigration by 10x and you've solved the demographic problem. And don't close yourself to the world for this. Don't stop exchanging. Don't stop being a desirable destination for tourism. or for people of all sorts of culture to come enjoy for six months and spend their money in the U.S., it's an overreaction, what's being done right now. And it's not perfectly targeted. Yes. Yes.  Let me just read some thoughts from Mencius Molebug, Curtis Yarvin. I am not... I have not been a fan of his for a very long time. Yeah. In fact, I've never really understood the appeal, to be honest. But he has said some interesting things here. Yeah, I just...  I mentioned the reactionary mind in the last time I said something. And what I find interesting about conservatives and the reactionary mind in general is that there's usually never any kind of positive, and you were sort of talking about this, there's nothing positive, there's no positive vision that's ever put forward. It's always in reaction, hence the term, to  progress, which is usually considered liberal. I think if we're going to sort of cycle analyze these people, I think a lot of this, to be honest, I think it really is sexual insecurity. And I think you can see this with the birth rates and their obsession with this. Now, if you look at natal policies around the world, they've basically all failed.  Whenever a government tries to pay people or anything like this, it almost always fails. Or it's a disaster like in Russia where women are literally giving birth to children with whiskey bottles in their hands or whatever. It's a disaster. But what they'll never address, and this is a liberal critique, but it's true, and that is sort of the economics at play.  It's just really expensive, first of all, to raise children. But it's also a pain in the ass. Like, children are extremely annoying. And in a post-industrial society where we no longer just survive, we actually can do other things, especially if you live in an urban center. there's really no incentive for you to have kids, at least not young, and at least not a lot of them, and at least not certainly at replacement late. There's just so many other things you can do with your life. And children are like the least interesting and least attractive option.  Well, it's very simple. I mean, when you were living on the farm, having kids means more hands, more workers, basically. There was a direct benefit. The change from children being an asset to a liability, I mean, that's the thing. You have to have a real desire for family life, which many people do. You have to have some Darwinian desire to survive. Yeah.  Or you have to be totally reckless and have knocked up people to have children. And all of these midwits are just... They're not going to make it, I guess, if they're making these calculations. You have to be somewhat...  a little bit odd, I guess, to want to do this. I understand middle-class people saying like children don't make sense in this market or something like what they're thinking rationally, but if they're ultimately totally suicidal, go on. Right. I agree. But I mean, the problem is, is that, I mean, birth rates declining is an issue for any population historically and currently. And so if you care about it, I mean, people spend so much time working, much more than we did in the past, at least in terms of, you know, you're talking about the farm. I mean, half of the year, you didn't even have to really worry about it that much very often, depending on what climate you're in. I mean, we just spend so much time at work. I mean, economists were talking about the 15-hour work week.  There are other people who would advocate for, you know, four days or whatever. I mean, there's things you could do, but they don't want to do these things. So it's a, it's sort of whining about a problem, but never willing to be creative about it. And, you know, liberals and socialists have, you know, advocated for these things and, you know, Republicans always oppose them. And they always, you know, in terms of populism, they'll always say, you know, we can't spend money on Ukraine. We need to spend it at home.  But they never actually spend it at home. They never want to spend it at home. So you know they're full of shit. 100%. Going back to the whole Trumpian fascism bit, let me read this from Molebug. So the headlines were Mench's Molebug, Curtis Yarvin, wants to flee America. And he said some interesting things here. So...  I just clip some of the highlights. When you see clips of mass DHS goons hauling off some equally mask anarchist, you may be tempted to cheer. Don't. Yes, charges will be filed. No, it will not harm the anarchist. It will make his day, his year, and maybe his life. All the money and power in the world will be at his defense.  He will not even need to lift a finger to organize his own lawyers, much less pay them. In the end, as with many of the BLM rioters, he will probably be well compensated with taxpayer funds for his trouble, not to mention all the pussy and or dick she he will, as a martyr, be entitled to. For the Islamicists, the reward is only in heaven, but for the leftists, it comes on Earth.  The reward for Stephen Miller and his ilk is also on earth. They look tough. They're doing something. They are not even doing 0.01% of what it would take to solve the problem, that at much more risk to themselves, the most they could probably do is 0.05%, matters not.  They can milk it as far as it goes. They too will sell books. I'm sure they understand this and are doing all they can, yet this does not change the facts. Politics is fundamentally about power. In power, large things are easier than small things.  This is where it actually gets interesting. And I generally agree with this assessment. Getting rid of all the liberal judges is easier than getting rid of all, what he meant one, getting rid of one liberal judge.  Getting rid of all the judges is easier than getting rid of all the liberal judges. Getting rid of the whole legal system is easier than getting rid of all the judges. Getting rid of the whole machine of government is easier than getting rid of the whole legal system. Getting rid of the whole philosophy of government is easier than getting rid of the whole machine of government.  Yes, there is a cancer. So what he's saying there is actually very important. And elsewhere in his essays, he's talking about there's no real category for these corrupt judges. You know, they'll use all this language. Democrat judges, Obama appointed judges, woke judges. What are you really talking about here? And what he's saying is that in politics, it's like you're using a machete and you're not using a scalpel. And so getting rid of the whole thing is easier than like removing one judge on the basis of wokeness. or whatever so you've got to be radical and they're not willing to be radical and what they're ultimately doing is stirring up the left who do have quite a bit of resources at the very least more resources resources than patriot front  So here's some other interesting comments. Yes, there is a cancer, a horrid black blotch growing. Everyone can see it now. Fox News will tell you about the black blotch, but it's superficial. Stephen Miller will get it off with a belt sander. Then Pam Bondi will dig into her makeup bag and find some concealer. It's fine. We're winning.  My brothers in Christ, you cannot even imagine what winning looks like. This is literal. You literally can't picture it. You can picture winning on this, winning on that, winning on the other thing, but winning overall, you can't picture it because you can't handle the truth. Try anyway, then put yourself in that headspace and look back at the things the Trump administration is trying to do today. Unfortunately, I rather expect you'll laugh. pretty much in line with what we were talking about earlier, unsatisfactory displays of success. I mean, I get the single story on TV showing that he did deport that one migrant.  But I don't get an overhaul of the system. And I fully agree with Moldbug here. We need to go machete. It needs to be the whole system of judges, advocates, lawyers. All of it is a whole drain on society. We need to find a more efficient solution. Yes.  I don't fear any crackdown on me from either Trump or from Democrats who get back in power. I mean, first off, I would just say if if these people are serious about taking back the government, then I'm not going to have a lot of respect for them if they just allow more elections to take place because they're going to lose them.  just by the nature of the game. It's back and forth, you know. Yankees win this year, Red Sox win the next year. That's how it's just been. So if you actually believe that they are a cancer on a mankind... or the American people at the very least, then you have to suspend elections and prevent them from coming in. Now, I personally don't fear the wrath of the Trumpian government. And I also don't fear the wrath of...  some sort of fascist liberal who comes in and does dark woke on our ass or something. But apparently Yorvin does. He has been directly connected to J.D. Vance and the Trump government. So I don't know, maybe they'll want to pull a Dugan on him or something. Maybe his fears are justified. I'm not sure they are, to be honest.  No, but I think he has a Jewish attitude, so they're quick to feel targeted and quick to run. When the shift starts sinking. That's true. That can be a real benefit. They are also highly neurotic. Mm-hmm.  Okay, let's talk a little bit about Taylor Swift before the time gets too late. You see that transition like fascism, Taylor Swift. Yeah. So.  How should I begin with this one? Taylor Swift has a new album. She's also getting married to Travis Kelsey, an American football star. I think his best days on the gridiron are behind him, but he was extremely good four or five years ago. And she seems to be moving into a new era.  And that is the suburban mom era, which is very curious. Now, I just want to play a little bit of this song just to give you a taste of what she's up to. So this includes the lyrics, but this song is called Opalite. I had a bad habit Of missing lovers past My brother used to call it Eating out of the trash It's never gonna last I thought my house was haunted  OK, I had a bad habit of missing lovers past. I think there's an apostrophe over the lovers. So she just she'll date some guy and not look into him. And her brother said, you're eating out of the trash. So it's interesting. Isn't it sort of like the. Almost like a kind of male perspective. Does she have a brother in real life?  Yes, she does, a younger brother. Okay. RFH, welcome. Yeah, we're starting to talk about Taylor Swift's RFH. Obviously, I need to hear now. I was going to take a guess that maybe she's talking of the perspective of Kelsey. But I didn't know she had a real, I didn't know she had a brother. Yeah. No, she has an actually younger brother. I think this is from her perspective.  I thought my house was haunted. She didn't learn too much about her boyfriends, and she paid the price for that. I used to live with ghosts. Used to live with ghosts. And all the perfect couples. Said when you know, you know. And when you don't, you don't. And all of the foes and all of the friends. They've seen it before, they'll see it again.  Life is a song, it ends when it ends  Okay, just to note, don't you find this almost like 50s quality to the tune? Yeah, isn't that, it's like... um one five six four i believe on the chord anyway it's a classic chord project project um progression that she's using and it's it's interesting that she's going there i don't know has she written songs like this in the past that have this almost like what is it like a bebop quality Yeah, I think that you're capturing, it's basically the housewife aesthetics of the 50s that we're seeing re-rise. We're seeing it with Sidney Sweeney. We're seeing it with Taylor Swift. And it's totally in line with what we discussed with the kind of reawakening, the heterosexual reawakening. of america and we're going back to it and the leftists are feeling it and they're nervous there was commentary about this album that it's kind of fascist because she says in other songs literally that she wants the whole block to look like her  Oh, yeah, we'll get there. We'll get to it. But I find this song very interesting because what she's saying is my mom is a hippie who sent me into the world wild where I had boyfriends that I didn't quite know where I was living with ghosts. But my mom told me, you know, take the lightnings. The lightnings were coming at you and it's OK that you've messed up. It's OK that that you live this kind of hippie leftist beginning.  But now everything is different. Now the world is all polite. Now I'm with Travis Kelsey, and now I'm settling down. So basically it's a coming-of-age story of a woman who's lived, and I've known women again and again like this, that have lived their 20s, that have wasted their 20s in absolute insanity and drugs and parties and 10 boyfriends at a shot.  That is how Taylor Swift feels right now. And she's expressed that it was a very unique album, that this is the album that needed to be made and that she's been wanting to do that for a couple of years now. I agree with most everything you said. And I do think that that's the meaning of the song. And then the song gets even more interesting as as we go on. But  And it's not like Taylor Swift was all that crazy. It's, you know, my favorite band, Depeche Mode, Dave Gahan literally died. He was so addicted to drugs and heroin, alcohol and so on. He, you know, somehow was revived in an emergency room. Taylor had some... bad relationships or something it's not exactly it's not the same um let's let's go on here because this is where it gets a little it's get gets even more interesting okay why you felt alone she's talking to Travis one would suggest because all of her other songs are about her boyfriend  I believe, though, that it may be her mom speaking to her. Okay. I want to listen more, but it's a possibility. Okay. Okay. She was in her phone and you were just a pose. She is speaking to Travis. She's speaking to Travis. Yes. Because that girlfriend, she didn't care about you. She was just on Instagram. But I love you. I don't know why I do the southern accent. It's just, you know. And don't we try to love, love We give it all we got We finally left the table And what a simple thought You're starving till you're not This life will beat you up, up, up, up This is just a temporary speedball But failure brings you freedom And I can bring you love Love Don't you sweat it, baby, it's all right Okay, so they repeat the chorus, and we can listen to the other songs about how the whole block will look like you and so on. Okay, now, Travis Kelsey, I'll just show some images here. He's had some black girlfriends, and I sort of...  Get it in a way to to defend Travis a little bit. He's been involved in football, which is. A very black sport and blacks succeed at football, even even quarterback to some degree, but but definitely every other position. And there's a sort of built-in black superiority to the NFL in college football, where a white running back is as rare as snow in July. Like, it just doesn't happen. And you're sort of reinforced on the gridiron with the notion that blacks are superior. So I sort of get the fact that he became a wigger, and I don't judge him. Um, but yes, he's had countless black girlfriends and she seems to be implying that they were all up in their phone, you know, on Instagram and they didn't really care about poor Travis. Like she cares about poor Travis. Now, uh, onyx stone. Um, okay. There it is. It's a beautiful stone. onyx stone uh it's uh quite black this thing this that he was going through and opalite stone opalite stone's different it's translucent and bluish and white and now the sky is opalite um  I've noticed I'm kind of stealing this take, I'll be honest, from woke activist on TikTok. But after I saw the woke activist, I was like, I'm not sure I believe this. And then I went and listened to the music last night. I was like, yeah, I think they're right. What is, I mean, it might be an unconscious metaphor, but she seems to be singing about how Travis was blacked. And now he's entered this opalite sky, and it's okay that we had some freedom and failure, but now we're together. And I just find it absolutely remarkable that she would publish a song like this.  Someone on the chat says that opalite would be the symbol for sperm in her song. The sky being opalite, she is being covered with Travis Scum after he's abandoned the black woman he was with. Wow. They had to be Instagram women who were pursuing sperm. celebrity the celebrity of Travis Kelch and so I'm not surprised that Taylor Swift comes at a more loving place with Travis and wants to deliver the normal love of a couple not the kind of attraction to celebrity and Instagram pictures and  and public attention because that's not something that Taylor gains with Travis. So in a way, they can get finally a much more normal relationship than Travis could have ever gotten with any of these black girls. And I think it resonates in her whole album. What do you think, R.F.H. ?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if she's actually trying to explicitly say it's racial. I just assume there's just a common metaphor, right? Like darkness and night is bad and light and sunshine are good. But I mean, I thought the same thing as JF here. I don't... I think it's more just that before he was dating insta thoughts that have a lot to gain from dating him, obviously. And he and Taylor are just on much more equal footing. Um, she doesn't have anything to gain really from Travis, like materially. She, she's a billionaire. She's the breadwinner. She's much more famous than he is. Um, she has a worldwide fame. Travis is only known in the United States and like now he's known worldwide because of who, because he's dating her. Um,  Um, so she doesn't have to date him for some leg up in the world. It's not, um... there's no material benefit in that case so that they are just on more equal footing and he's kind of arm candy in the way that like a it's usually the football player who marries like a former stripper or something like that's almost what you expect where he he's not demanding anything from her outside of looking good on his arm at the party and and you know  obviously being wild in the sack or something. But it's almost... And I don't want to demean their relationship, but she said it's like the English teacher and the gem teacher got together. And the English teacher is a lot more intelligent than the gem teacher. LAUGHTER  And she is more thoughtful than he is. He's, I mean, great athlete. I genuinely like Travis Kelsey and he, he was a, he's a remarkable tight end, maybe one of the top five tight ends ever. And so I, and I don't dislike his personality. I, I, he's, he's totally fine. I wish him the best, but he, he, he's kind of dumb.  I think he might be smarter than people realize, though. I don't think he's completely retarded. I think he probably has dyslexia, to be honest. He just can't spell. But I don't know. When they announced the new album on his podcast, Taylor was kind of ribbing and being like...  You're pretending to not know things that you know. You act dumber than you are. I think there's a bit more depth to Travis than people realize. I don't know. He probably leans into the fact that he's a jock and he's a football player and he's around probably a number of dumb people.  That's true. You don't want to be – when you're leading a team onto the field, you don't want to be overly smart. You want to be like, let's go get them, boys. Like, we're all in this together. That's how you're a leader. So it benefited him to sort of act dumb, you know, or not deep, at the very least. I think he's smarter than he leads people to believe. I don't think it's, like, this complete, like, situation where she's just dating this – idiot and like they can't relate to each other i do think they are actually able to have conversations okay um let's uh let's play wish list here um this is also an interesting one  They want that yacht life under chopper blades. They want those bright lights and Balenci shades and a fat ass with a baby face. They want it all. They want that complex female character. So it's, it's like the Instagram world and she's using the word, the pronoun they, that's what they want. But I think not too long ago, Fairly or unfairly, probably mostly unfairly, conservatives would have probably associated her with all these things. You know, she's much like Kim Kardashian or something. I mean, I think that is unfair. Yeah. Yeah. They want that critical smash palm de orre And an Oscar on the bathroom floor They want it all And they should have what they want They deserve what they want Hope they get what they want I just want you  We tell the world to give us love for cologne and they do. Wow. Got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball hoop. Okay. Just for our non-American listeners, a driveway with the basketball hoop, that is just classic suburbia.  Because it's for the kids. Sometimes you roll it out. Sometimes it's up on the top of the garage. That is just classic middle classness right there. And she's dreaming about that. Interesting. I just want you. They want that freedom living off the grid. They want those three dogs that they call their kids.  OK, this just seems to be an attack on liberals right now. I mean, this is they want those three dogs that they call their kids. This sounds like the online right talking or Ben Shapiro. Yeah. It's quite something. Good sir. They want a contract with Real Madrid They want that spring break that was fucking lit And then that video taken off the internet They want it, oh And they should have what they want They deserve what they want I hope they get what they want I just want you, yeah to give us the cologne and they don't wow got me dreaming about a driveway with a basketball i made wishes on all of the stars please god bring me a best friend who i think is  That's the most millennial your favorite thing ever uttered. Yeah. I want a best friend who's hot. Yeah. I want to marry my. Yeah. This is similar to like, you know, Alabama, Arkansas, like Ma and Pa, apple pie. You're my best friend. Yeah. It's it's still that sentiment. It's done in a in a different way. so here is just a theory that i have so she comes from a wealthy background in pennsylvania and she did country music at the beginning and she did this sort of underdog like things like you know i wear t-shirts you wear short shorts um i you're cheer captain i'm on the bleachers i guess i mangled that one but you get the point um so it was it was a kind of like nice girl type attitude and then she went into her mid to late 20s and 30s of being a little bit of a baddie um not not not definitely not madonna or lady gaga but a little bit of a a baddie and constant boyfriends and heartache and and and so on and i think what really changed her attitude is she she endorsed joe biden she endorsed kamala harris but this is what i think happened is she  She didn't just marry a handsome guy because Travis Kelsey is not a musician. He's not an actor. He's not a businessman. He's a football player, the most American apple pie thing you could ever possibly do. And he's a white football player as well. So there's not that tension. And at the Super Bowl, when the Kansas City Chiefs were playing and they lost, the camera showed her in her box and she was booed.  audibly. Now, maybe that was, you know, maybe some people were cheering, some were booing. I don't quite know, but it was audible. And I feel like she felt that she lost her audience because like if Nine Inch Nails got booed at the Super Bowl, that would almost be cool. They would like flick everyone off and be like, yeah, we, I hate you too, you know, but that's  Taylor Swift is not that. She's not even Madonna. I think the whole notion that she's a sex maniac or teaching girls to run wild is overstated. She is a good girl. She does not push the envelope with her music or with her persona. And the fact that she lost her audience, I think that actually affected her.  And she she realizes that a new era is in store for her. And that new era is singing the praises of the soccer mom or the basketball mom in this case. And I don't know. I think it's interesting. And if if like for a conservative to criticize Taylor Swift at this point,  after she's embraced Opalite, I think it's totally wrong. She's now coded Republican for better and for worse. This is her new era right now. What you see is what you get. She is singing the praises of getting, who cares about that Instagram stuff? I wanna have two kids with Travis  in a Dallas suburb and just make money. I don't want to hear about that stuff. Woke or like, she's got a big fat ass or politics. I don't care about that stuff. That's what she is promoting. And it's, it's remarkable. Well, the thing is she always has been coded as Republican. I, this isn't new. I think a lot of people, I don't know, maybe it's that they didn't really start paying attention to her. after like 2016 or so when she endorsed some democrat races um and like yeah like on the outside she was endorsing some democrats but her music has always been about wanting to get married and have kids like that's actually not new at all and it's always been embraced by a certain type of white middle class girl in the suburbs um that was always her main target audience and it was always about love and relationships and wanting to fall in love and wanting to find the one and and it just wasn't working out for whatever reason but that's always what she wanted um  And I don't think that this is really that much of a big change for her. It's just that I guess on her one album, Midnight's, she kind of writes about not wanting this stuff. But that's because she was dating this guy, Joe Alwyn, for like six years and he just wasn't proposing to her. So I think this is just like a cope.  Like, oh, I don't want that anyways. And then on this next album, she just immediately, like, yeah, that was a lie. I did want to get married. And it's like, well, yeah, we already knew that. You always wanted to get married. You were always thinking about Romeo and Juliet and the wedding dress. And, oh, he gets down on his knees. And this was always the image he had in mind. And it's always the... aesthetic she used um she's always just been like a young kind of lovelorn girl so i don't think this is that shocking and it's it's kind of the same yeah i think you're right the teams were the same but there is a resolution in this album there is a settling down yes because he's actually engaged now because before she was pursuing she was dreaming or  And I fully agree with the analysis of Richard. Excellent analysis. I think she's a people pleaser who's returning to her natural state. And she got into a people pleasing state in which she ended up being pulled into kind of left wing politics, Biden, abortion. Doing a whole video clip walking through the New York subway and singing her song with the people. She was the city girl pursuing love and failing at it. And now she is something else. There is a change there, and it will be a symbolic change, especially for the women who take another branch, for the women who continue to be bitter in their 30s, who don't switch to the soccer mom life, and who remain attached to the points of wokeness that America is about to abandon. So I believe there will be a bunch of frustrated women who will be pissed off at Taylor Swift.  I mean, yeah, there are. And I think that's right. I think it is a lot of women who haven't decided to, I guess, get married. And they are kind of angry about the album for that reason. But again, I just think it's kind of silly because it's clearly what she always wanted to do. It's always what she's saying about. I guess it's just now that it's actually happening and she actually has the ring.  they're, I don't know, they're shocked. I guess they just expected it to somehow never happen. It was always just going to be about this pursuit, but she's 35, so... But can she make albums after that? Like, I'm reminded of Sarah Stock's notorious tweet about, like, I won, which was quite something to say, to be honest, when you got an engagement ring. But, like, if it...  Is she ruined by her success? Does she need to get divorced to write another album, as someone joked in the chat? Once you achieve the thing that you're always dreaming for, then there's no more tension. Getting married and settling down in the suburbs is kind of blissful when it's a dream.  that you can sing about. But actually doing it, you realize the insufferable ennui that the suburbs represent. And there's no need for art at that point, if you understand what I'm saying. There's a lack of desire. Yeah. No, I've always thought that when she finally does find this man, that...  Yeah, will she even be able to continue with her music in this way? I mean, I think this album isn't as good. It has been a bit of a disappointment. There's some good tracks on there. But yeah, it does seem just a little... I don't know, like the wind's been taken out of the sails a bit. And I'm not surprised by that because I think she actually is just like happy and settled with Travis and things are calm and he's not... I don't know, playing these crazy games with her. Like the guys she dated before were just kind of... don't know they're man children and they kind of yeah they're kind of just immature and kind of tugged her around and he's a child man exactly he's like yes he actually seems very like stable and actually like kind um and i think it's it's harder to write music with um without that sort of tension and  Yeah. I don't know what is next in terms of music for her, but if it turns out like it's just over, uh, I think that's fine. I think she's had a very great career. She literally became a billionaire off of this and it's nice that it worked out for her in the end. And I'm happy for her. So, well, I'm happy for her too, but I, I guess I, I wouldn't be honest here if I, if I didn't bash Taylor Swift, uh, just a little bit. Um,  there have been a number of rock icons throughout the ages. And we can think of Elvis. We can think of the Beatles. Um, we, we can even fast forward to Madonna in particularly in the eighties, so she has had a long career and maybe the end of rock and roll with Nirvana and all of these examples of iconic musicians, uh,  They were setting the trend and pushing the envelope and indeed indeed shocking the public. And sonically and culturally, so Elvis at one point, CBS had a policy that they wouldn't photograph Elvis below the waist because he was gyrating too much and it was who. It would inspire women to lose their morals just by watching Elvis dance on black and white television. And it's now incredible to even think about this because culture has progressed so much that when we look back at Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show, it seems wholesome and quaint, like something your grandparents would like. The reality is that Elvis was like... kurt cobain in his time didn't they arrest him what i wanted they arrested him at like one of his concerts for this oh yeah absolutely lewd behavior yeah there's no doubt about it he was pushing the envelope and he was also promoting a kind of um blackness in white form yeah you know like nirvana in the early 90s Everyone was talking about this album, and some Democrats like Tipper Gore thought it might be banned. It's just too far. It's not music. It's nihilistic. I think they're absolutely right in their characterization. We transitioned from hair bands and overproduced pop music... uh to an out of tune guitar heavily distorted lyrics you can't understand you know a mosquito mulatto my libido all of this just stuff like what in the hell is this we we don't even know but we know it's bad and it's corrupting the youth it it is terrifying  On some level, Madonna herself, she pushed the envelope. She had different moods and styles, and she ended up, you know, she ended up promoting almost S&M and in the late 80s and early 90s.  a kind of dark liberation. She would also have, you know, fantasies of of love and sex in a, you know, a Spanish seaside and evoking all sort of exotic things. What I'm saying is that sonically and culturally, these bands were Dionysian. They showed various faces of Dionysus and they would shock the public and push the envelope.  Taylor seems to be an almost mascot of her fan base. So white women who are millennials, who are basically her age, like Taylor Swift. And I feel like they're...  their enjoyment of the music is almost fake. And I know this is extremely mean to say, but it's like they like the idea of Taylor Swift as opposed to being something good. It's the idea of a good. It's like, wouldn't it be wonderful If I liked this music by Taylor Swift because she's me and she's sort of basic and kind of attractive, but maybe not too attractive and not terribly sexy. I don't I'm not saying she's unattractive, but not dangerous in the slightest bit. And it's like this mutual kind of dialectic that her fans and Taylor Swift would undergo, where it's like, I'll pretend to like this music while I pretend to perform it, enjoy performing it. Like, it's not actually good. It's vapid. But they like the idea of a kind of basic bitch millennial being powerful and like even making billions of dollars which they love it reminds me of like hassan piker where there's no contradiction between his communism and making millions of dollars on on twitch because you know his fans see him as like a mascot like he's he's taking it away from the man you know if you understand my meaning it's it's all fake it's fake enjoyment you're no one's really enjoying that music i enjoy it  All fandom is like this. All these groups that passed over the years in my youth, you had children. They wanted to be fans of the Backstreet Boys. They wanted to be fans of the Spice Girls. It's a construction. It's a social construction, the elevation of a queen or a king. And that is what public engagement always is in some form. Well, with her, it's just intense. As someone who's like actually a Swiftie here and has been for a long time, I will say that I've never pretended to like her music. I just found it relatable and fun. And she's a good storyteller. And that's why I think a lot of young women liked her. She just tells a really good story. She's not necessarily a great singer. Her vocals aren't really that great. But, yeah, she's just a very good storyteller and a lot of young women related to the story she was telling. And I think it was just kind of captivating. I don't think people were pretending to like it. Well, don't you understand that like music? I agree with it. I'm obviously going to allow you to push back on my opinion.  misogynistic attack on Taylor Swift. But what I was saying, like, you know, at the end of Puccini's Tosca, like, Scorpio, Avanti Dio! And it's like loud music.  high singing notes, much higher than I was singing in falsetto. Scarpie, I'll See You Before God, as a woman literally throws herself off the stage in the world of Tosca to her death, while the orchestra is blaring. The curtain comes down. It's shocking.  There's no one, even you can not even like opera. You just watch that five minutes of it. And you're like, wow, this gets to like human passion and death and desire. Just boom. Or when, you know, Don Jose stabs Carmen, the woman he loves outside of the bull ring.  Like, whoa, he loves her so much, he's just got to kill her. And it gets to some dark part of our soul, you know, when you see that. Or like even, you know, I do think music kind of shocks you less as time goes by. But if you really kind of put yourself in the right direction, mindset of listening to like a live performance of nirvana it's distorted it's it's ugly it's it's kind of savage it's drug addled it's it's getting at something that's genuinely shocking like the music can shock you it can drag you into that dionysian world of death and desire And in your defense of Taylor Swift, you use the R word, which is relatable, which I think almost reinforces what I was saying in the sense that it's a fake, it's a dialectic. You like the idea of Taylor Swift because it's kind of nice to think of a millennial woman who has sort of basic problems like everyone does on stage and that's fine i'm not i'm not saying it's like evil or or or whatever i not not in the slightest bit i sort of liked the music i kind of liked it maybe more than the swifty fans did that like kind of bebop sound but it's not what music can be Music can take you, it's not about living in the suburbs or relating to the fact that she got dumped and I got dumped and I get, it's about like showing you the darkness of existence on this planet. It's about showing your own desire that might, your desire for love that might spill over into homicide. That's what music's about.  Well, I think a lot of people aren't that deep. And they just like the basicness of her. I don't think that means they're pretending to like it. I think they just can't really go further than that, probably. Yeah. Millennials. CBG.  By the way, I say all these things passionately, and obviously I go over the top a little bit. But, you know, it's all in good fun. You know, I like to talk about things that I find great. But you can like Taylor Swift. It's allowed. It's allowed. CBG, you can go.  Yeah, hi. Can you guys hear me? Yes. Okay, great. Yeah, I feel like maybe I'm just sort of restating in another way what's already been said, so I'll keep it brief. But I don't know. I think that Taylor Swift, in a lot of ways, people glommed on to her because she represented the dreams and aspirations of the normal girl, the girl next door. And this whole arc with Travis, it's funny because you see her giving up her aspirations for American aristocracy in the traditional sense, the wanting to be a Kennedy. And I think really what that says to her fan base, the fan base who is kind of aging up in the way she is, it's time to get married, it's time to have kids. It's saying, like, it's okay. It's okay to have your dumb, fat, balding husband. It's actually really fun. Yeah.  And you can, you know, you can laugh at him and you can, you know, be the center of his world. And, you know, in that way, I mean, I think Taylor Swift always has been an opiate for the masses, especially the young woman masses. And it's just... An opalite for the masses. Yes. Yeah, it's a big, shiny load of opalite, but... But I think, yeah, it's funny because you do see a lot of resentment and it's the resentment from her fan base that she's almost aging past. It's like she's leaving some of them behind. And for these other kind of probably very friendly, very nice, kind of normal, mediocre girls, she's saying like, yes, this is our life. And it's fine. You know, it's fine to not have the prince charming in the mansion. I mean, you look at the visuals of her old music videos. It's all sorry. Go ahead.  Sorry, I thought someone else was talking. But yeah, that's pretty much all I wanted to say is that, you know, it's just this evolution into, yes, we're going to embrace suburbanism. And, you know, your husband isn't going to be John F. Kennedy. He's not going to be Prince Charming, but he's going to be just fine for you. And it's going to be great. And you're going to love your kids and you're going to love your house and your white picket fence. So, I mean, you know, take it for what it is. I think there will always be a section of the populace that, you know, that is... what they want and she's sort of embracing her role as a as a totem for it and you know it's fine because she couldn't be the the messy good girl blonde girl forever but anyway i mean travis is wildly successful he's not like some dumb fat guy in the burbs yeah it's a different give him a few years  It's a different thing, though. I mean, the way they look, the way he dresses, kind of working class, and he's not, you know, I mean, it's a totally different aesthetic than, I forget his name, Joe Altwin. Joe Altwin. Yeah, and, I don't know, the Kennedy boy and Harry Styles and all these, you know, sort of sexy, metropolitan, in-the-know looking guys. It's like, yes, like, love your Luddite husband. It's good. It's simpler that way. So...  Well, Richard, you got the ladies talking with this subject. That's the idea here. It's Taylor Swift hour. Come on now. It's Taylor Swift time. Set aside an hour for feminism here. Well, I mean, yeah, Travis is a big change from her other boyfriends in the sense that she pretty much just dated other artistic types before. Actors.  musicians, and they were always just quite messy. And Travis is the first celebrity she's dated that just has really nothing to do with what she does. There's just no overlap. He's a football player. But I think that's actually why it's worked out.  I think with other artists, it's just too unstable and too messy. And then the guys have these egos where they feel like they're in competition with her and she's just much more successful than the other men she's dated. But it doesn't really matter that she's more successful than Travis because Travis catches a football and that just is a completely different skill set. There's just no overlap and has nothing to do with what Taylor does. And yeah i just i don't think it like i don't think it gets in the way of his ego and i don't think it um i think it works because of that i agree but i do think on some level it is the death of this fantasy the young love fantasy the you know merging of intellectual artistic souls the beautiful like tumblr ass you know i mean it's just  It's a different thing. It's a more mature, honestly, realistic thing for her fans to aspire to. I mean, not that her fans are going to be dating men in the NFL, but their husbands will more closely resemble Travis Kelsey than they would resemble any of those other boys in the past. Yeah. Well, because he's like a grug brain. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but with the artist type, it always is this big tragedy, whereas the grug-brained husband is the one who you will have your four kids and your basketball hoop on the garage with. Yeah. Do you think that this is going to inspire a kind of baby boom? No. dramatic but maybe on the edges well okay you say no but like people assume correctly that music that talks about drug use is going to lead people to use drugs and i find that to be a totally reasonable assumption clearly that's the case here's why okay A lot of the women who listen to Taylor Swift are already the types of women who want to get married and have kids. They already want to do that. The reason they haven't had kids yet is probably because the man in their life  is just dragging his feet along. That's usually what happens with those types of women. So I don't think Taylor is going to convince a group of all these young men in the suburbs dating young women, it's time to propose and knock her off. I think those women already want these things and they're waiting around for a ring.  Well, even if they already want it, she's nudging them along the way. That's what I'm saying. I'm not saying it's going to be reverse demographic trends totally, but I think this is a new era in which I would suggest that there are going to be babies born that otherwise would not exist due to the publication of this album. I would strongly suggest that.  Yeah. And it it changes. I think for some of the fans, maybe it'll change for the women, the men in their lives who I don't know, maybe just I mean, I'm talking about peripheries here, but, you know, maybe for some it'll change.  which men they give a second look to. I mean, you see this with Lana Del Rey and her gator husband or whatever. God, don't get me started. It's like, you know, it says, you know, maybe give a second look to that hillbilly. Maybe give a second look to that simple boy who just finished high school. Like, why not? RFH, how could you... criticize gator husband when you don't criticize football husband like are they not just variations on a theme no no okay no he is a swamp man from like the bayou he's disgusting he's like actual white trash travis is larping as white trash okay  It's just two different things. Travis is actually successful. He's not as dumb as he is, as he's pretending to be. He actually is nice to Taylor. He seems to take interest in her. He already liked her before. He liked her music before. I think that's quite sweet.  And he pursued her and like showed up with the friendship bracelet or whatever to her concert. This guy was plucked out of some swamp by some sad, desperate woman who just like, I don't know, did it for like the meme.  I don't respect it. She has the bigotry of the city girl. I do. I do. I am bigoted. I don't think that a wildly successful, talented woman should be pursuing some man from a swamp who rapes alligators all day. I just don't.  I think he's the ultimate form of the man. And you city girls will never understand, but you will always end up with more beta males than Alana Del Rey. And you deserve it. Wow. Wow. I shut her up. I shut RFI to. destroyed by facts and logic look there's no reason she had to pluck that man out of the swamp she could have found he's he's in much my argument is that travis and gator man are are variations on a theme you know as much as we can criticize football and the football culture i  worthy of criticism, no doubt about it. There's something fucking primal about standing across a line of scrimmage from someone who is also wants to kill you and to slam into them and just to say, mano a mano, let's see who comes out of this.  That's what football is on some level. And so there is a primal greatness to football, despite all of the things that I agree should be criticized. Here's a man, and I don't know that much about Gator Man. I'm just making assumptions here. But while Travis has to fight off a 300-pound defensive lineman, this guy... goes and kills an alligator in a swamp, an alligator who's five times stronger than he is, that has a protective armor, that has teeth like knives that can easily kill a man. That's more terrifying than any defensive end. I don't think they're killing them. Both men are kind of... They're alphas in their own kind of way. And they're getting in touch with... what it means to be human on the most elemental level who would win 100 travis kelch or one gator man i don't think he's like killing the gators i don't think he's battling gators you claimed he was raping them only minutes ago i mean that's something to kill a gator is one thing to make love to one is quite another  He's French and perverted, so I just assume that there's some silly business going on. But I think he's just doing gator tours. I don't think he's battling alligators. I think he's just showing the civilized city folk that come down to the swamp. Here's the dinosaur. Fair enough. I don't think he's wrassling them. Well, you never know. Real quick, Raphael, and then I actually need to run, but this has been a great conversation, but real quick, Raphael. Yeah, something I realized that the sort of dream that Taylor is sort of trying to get towards with Kelsey and her middle-class thing is actually exactly what his brother has. So his brother, Jason Kelsey, who was a center for the Eagles, he's not a wigger, and maybe sort of that evolved. They play different positions, you know? Maybe Travis is with the receivers, and they're all black or whatever. But, you know, Jason has a blonde wife. Jason's with the white offensive linemen, yeah.  Yes. Yeah, exactly. But yeah, he, he's got a beautiful blonde wife. They have four daughters. He's like just a normal white guy, you know? So, so maybe she, she saw Travis and she saw Jason and she thought I can, I can have what Jason has with Travis. It's basically the same thing. She sort of saw the vision maybe. All right. Yeah. Clearly as JF is proving there's evidence that this guy is pretty bad-ass. I mean, I wouldn't do that.  Doesn't Apollo slay some sort of amphibian? He slaves Python, yes. Yeah, well, it's sort of in the image of the Python, yeah. No doubt. Well, we won't solve the battle of the sexes on this episode, but thank you all for being here. This is a great show, and I have unfortunately got to run. JF, as always, thank you for being here. Bye-bye. And I will talk to you guys later. Ciao.

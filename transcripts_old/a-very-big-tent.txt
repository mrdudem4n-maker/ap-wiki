Okay. How is everyone doing? I hope you're doing well. What I thought we'd do today is talk about some loose ends that we didn't get to with JF on Thursday and Sunday, past two episodes.  And take more questions from our group on the Kirk situation or really anything else. Perhaps we're overly focusing on this, but I think it's hard not to. And I have some more videos that I'd like to play and get through.  And then at 3 p.m. my time, 5 p.m. Eastern time, there is the arraignment of Tyler Robinson in Utah. And I don't know if we want to watch that live. I wasn't fully planning on doing three hours and then going into it. We might want to  Take a break, say after 2 p.m. my time or 4 p.m. Eastern time and then read rejoin for the arraignment. I have to say I am fascinated by it. I I think there might very well be some drama. So at this arraignment, Tyler Robinson will be read the charges now.  I don't know. Is there a lawyer here who can correct me? But is this the time in which he will offer an initial plea or does he not have to say anything? I presume he probably has the right not to even offer a formal plea. But I don't know. It's something I do want to watch. Perhaps nothing will happen.  So yeah, he has been indicted. He will be given a plea. So does anyone know anything about this? Just speak up if you know something. Don't just use the chat. Yeah, someone who watches an embarrassing amount of courtroom stuff on YouTube. I'm kind of an addict to those things, but they do enter a plea. I understand.  So say that again. He doesn't have to give a plea or he will give a plea? Like the first thing they do. I can't understand what you're saying. Just say yes or no. He will give a plea? Yes, he will. He will give a plea. Okay. But obviously he can change that plea as things go on. Brian Koberger pled not guilty and then confessed everything. Yeah. A lot of times if these people don't wish to enter a plea, like if they intend to just invoke the Fifth Amendment, they'll automatically give them almost like a not guilty or a nolo contendere plea. Right. Meaning that they're going to proceed with the investigation. Whereas if they just plead guilty, it essentially stops right there. Right. Right. yeah i mean that that's that's the thing about all of this um i i also i i presume the court is going to give him the benefit of the doubt that is if he refuses to speak that will be considered not guilty in effect uh they're not going to not give him the benefit of the doubt and say oh this means you're guilty so that that is very true there's also this other issue with it all which is that  Pleading guilty, yes, the prosecution will present a timeline and evidence and so on. And they will make sure that this is not a person of unsound mind confessing to a crime that he didn't commit or confessing to a crime under duress or something like that. They will make sure that that's the case.  But the full trial doesn't happen. And so I think with a number of these cases, you know, Brian Koberger, I have not really been obsessed about that case or I looked into it a little bit.  But the lack of a trial does leave open these loose ends. I mean, he was a month after the murders of these young people in Idaho. He was driving across the country with his father. I mean, I'm sorry, but does that not raise some questions? Is his father an accessory? Did he know? Should he have known? Those are interesting questions that probably never will be answered because of the guilty plea. Similar to... Yeah, go on. If Robinson really wanted to die on the pyre and take all responsibility and shift blame away from the boyfriend or from whatever network he could be involved with, the thing to do would be to take the guilty plea so as to not... implicate more people in the crime but then you that brings into question was he expecting these people to also kind of like take a vow of silence and not like you know you hear about the boyfriend who's supposedly working with the fbi and right is this was this the plan all the all along where you know he thought they were also going to shut up and now he's like well fuck them that's fascinating  Yeah. What you say is absolutely true. Yeah, I was thinking as well of this case that I took a deep dive into, the Chris Watts case. I've mentioned it a number of times. He's sort of a fascinating... neighborhood psychopath it's just very it's just an odd person but one thing that's fascinating about him is that it's just the story always changes and so you don't no one quite knows what the truth of the matter is he confessed in While being interrogated to murdering his wife and he accused his wife of murdering their two daughters. And so it was a sort of blame shift or I'm not that bad. Quasi self-defense or something like or rage or something. So he he confessed to something that that I don't think was the truth. And then they brought charges for the murder of three people, and he pled guilty to that, so there was no real trial. And he's told various stories in the aftermath, different timelines, and their questions of whether other people were involved. And so I guess it's... The issue is it's like when you're dealing with a liar, when you're dealing with a psychopath who has not only empathy, but no sense of the truth. It's just all pure manipulation and interpersonal hedging that you never really find out what happened. There's no...  I don't know. So I agree with you. I'm just using that case as an example of what's going to happen. What is he going to say? Is he going to take all the blame to basically shut down the investigation? These investigations cost millions and millions of dollars. You could just, you know, on some level, the government doesn't want to prosecute you because there's a built-in risk, if a small one, of your getting off. There is millions upon millions of dollars in just money, but also opportunity cost. That is, we have limited resources. You have to push them in one way. But the fact is, I want those resources going to this because I just simply want to know the truth of the matter. Right. There's the issue of the people from out of state who were seemingly at his residence a week or two prior, like a bunch of out of state license plates that his neighbor witnessed and said that he felt uncomfortable about or that these people seem to be up to no good.  Yeah, he said the vibes were bad, I think is what he said, but which is interesting. It's also interesting that you would even notice that. Well, if you start seeing a bunch of cars parked on your street that aren't normally there and, you know, it's not out of the ordinary to bar these people or where are they going and  especially they're all out of state plates. Like it's one thing if your neighbor is having, having their family over and you know, there's two or three cars, but there's eight or 10 cars of all different States. That would raise some suspicion in me even. Fair enough. Before I'll go to Austin. Yeah. Austin you have a question there.  Yeah, the thing with Discord, what is their deal? Are they just not going to be transparent with what's going on or they have a good case as well? Well, let me get into this. First off, RFH is here. I just saw that you have chimed in. And so I really like it when you're involved in the conversation. So RFH, how are you doing?  I'm well, thank you. Good. So there's a lot of interesting things here. And I want to talk about the Israel question most definitely. But first off... These platforms, I'm not sure I have an answer of how to solve these problems, but these platforms are extremely problematic and they are in a very bad incentive. They have a very bad incentive structure. In other words, they're incentivized to obscure matters,  Uh, et cetera. So, Roblox, for instance, um, this is a game that I'm, uh, sort of casually familiar with. My, my daughter played Roblox for like a week and then lost interest.  And it's sort of a virtual world kind of thing. I don't quite even, I'm not sure I quite understand it. But even then, I was worried about her doing it. Not for the game itself, of course, but for the fact, it's not the game, it's the chat room and so on. But anyway, she no longer plays this. But from what I've heard, there are a tremendous amount of sexual predators. who get into this app and it's almost like the perfect realm for these people because you're it's like sims back in the day you're like pretending to be a digital character and interacting with people and talking you get to you know hiding your identity as part of the game or creating a new identity as part of the game and it's just inherently awful And Roblox, I'm sure, you know, I would imagine does the bare minimum for these things, but the problem exists. And I think they're incentivized to... sort of play Goldilocks with it, that is, go after egregious cases, but not to over-police not-so-egregious cases, because that takes time, money, and resources and sort of makes them look bad in a way. So, Discord is the same thing. I mean, how...  of the last like 10 school shooters, how many of them have been on Discord? You know, you're using this platform for whatever reason. And no, I don't think the platform is haunted or inherently likely to lead to murder or something, but what is going on there? And someone correct me if I'm wrong, but with Discord,  You create your own private server. Isn't that what it is? So it's not like a timeline app like Twitter where everything is basically centralized. You can obviously create like a chat group or something, but you create your own server and it's not hosted on your computer, but it is sort of your property and it's closed off and you have to invite people in. Am I right on this?  Yes, you're walled off like that, and you create your own and invite people. Right. And so they were creating servers for various games, but then also two weeks ago when we watched that investigation into Order of Nine Angles and all this horrible shit, they were just creating their own servers, so it was sort of like... can we can we go locate someone and invite them into this dungeon of our digital dungeon of our own design basically yeah yeah so i i don't know and is that server your property is that the equivalent to your home so that the feds need a search warrant to go in is that the property, I presume it's ultimately the property of Discord, they're the ones hosting it, it's on their server, but I don't know, perhaps it's an ambiguous situation. But yes, Discord said this, they came out swinging right away that this, we did not, the planning of this event was not done on our servers.  And then, as you probably know, this was released in the Washington Post yesterday. And then I believe it was on Sunday that Discord chats were released in the New York Times with... The first chats that were released on Sunday, basically, Tyler Robinson was talking about the murder, and he was acting a lot like what I've read that Brian Koberter acted. That is, he was coy. And Brian Koberger was apparently using the name, what was it, Jolly Roger or something like that, which might very well be a reference to Elliot Roger, the famed incel killer. But anyway, Papa Rogers may be his name. I can't remember. But he was following the case, and in fact, he might have known things about the case that had not been revealed to the media yet. In other words, he might have been expressing private knowledge of what happened. After all, he did it.  That was not public knowledge. So it's quite spooky. Tyler Robinson seemed to be doing something similar. And so we talked about this yesterday on Sunday of, you know, I think my doppelganger did it. I bet I better get rid of the exact copy of the rifle that's in my house right now. Ha ha ha. This sort of joking, trying to diffuse the situation, but if you take those posts seriously, it's almost making it worse. Very curious behavior. Now, you could also say that that type of behavior is exculpatory because, you know, he wasn't confessing to it right away. Now, there is another revelation in the Washington Post yesterday that he ultimately fessed up to his friends on Discord. And he said, I'm sorry, guys. That was me at UVU, Utah Valley University. uh thanks for the laughs talk talk to you later it was incredible the sort of casualness with it um it's also worth pointing out that that isn't exactly a confession so he said it was me at uvu um  You know, he didn't say it was me who pulled the trigger of that gun. It was me who shot Charlie Kirk. So is the defense going to treat this as, look, that comment he made, that came in the context of his sarcastic comments about his doppelganger and the exact copy of the gun. It doesn't mean anything. It's not a confession.  You could make that argument. Now, obviously, the prosecution is going to make the reverse argument, but you could make that argument.  I don't quite know what to make of it. This matter gets worse with Kash Patel because he went on Fox and Friends yesterday morning and he said something that was just unbelievably weird in a way. He said that there was a note...  that stated that he needs to take this opportunity to kill Charlie Kirk. And he said the word note. And then he said that note has since been destroyed, but we have evidence of the existence of the note, and we have acquired this knowledge through our, in his words, aggressive interview posture.  Now, I have no idea what any of that means. First off, he said a note and not a post, and it's been destroyed. So what that evoked in my mind was, this is the situation that came to my imagination, is that he wrote that on like a notepad,  And then burned the evidence, but then they got the notepad. And like that scene from The Big Lombowski and the detective novels it was based on, like The Big Sleep, where you could see the impression of the writing in the notepad. It's kind of fun to do this, to play detective, like, you know.  That's what I thought too. Whenever I visit people, that's what I'm always doing. I'm looking at their notepads. But no. I thought that too. It's the only thing that makes sense. That's the only thing that makes sense. Now, why didn't he say he deleted the message? which is easy to say, but you could say he deleted the confession, but we got it on the server because nothing's ever deleted truly at Discord. Okay, that's fine, but why did he say this? And, I mean, you could take this in a number of different ways. Is Kash Patel bullshitting? Like, there's no reason for the FBI director to be going on Fox News every day, twice a day, in fact.  outside of he wants to be seen by Donald Trump as the man on the case. Please don't fire me. But from what I've heard from other people, he's making things worse. And yeah, I mean, he's handing things to the defense. The defense could say,  Cash Patel has not behaved properly. He's tainted the jury pool in Utah, maybe everywhere, and he can't get a fair trial. I mean, they of course could say that. Maybe have good reason to. But what...  I don't know why there's no pushback, at least from the person interviewing Kash Patel. I don't know what he's implying exactly. The idea that you, particularly a Zoomer kid, or even, yeah, Zoomer, maybe he's even Gen Alpha, Zoomer kid, writing handwritten notes and destroying, that just strikes me as odd. What is he even saying? It sounds like a forced confession, right?  True. The aggressive interview posture. Why are you bragging about an aggressive interview posture? Absolutely. You should be saying the exact opposite thing, which is that this person with goodwill and good faith came and told us this. That's much better. If there's any hint of you're torturing people at the FBI, the evidence is going to be thrown out. They are so desperate to make it seem like they've done something that he's resorting to saying that they are essentially putting people under duress to confess because otherwise it looks like they've done nothing.  Yes, because also doesn't that appeal? I think it's the boyfriend they're putting under duress. I think that the implication that they found the notepad and then they deciphered it, you wouldn't make the comment about we obtain this information through our aggressive interview tactics. That sounds like they're threatening the boyfriend with you are going to be charged unless you give us something we can use. And he says, okay, well, there was this note that he wrote and I'll testify to it.  Yeah, but then he burned it. Which probably, which strikes to me, sounds like a desperate lie. You know, like a sort of understandable lie. Like, you know, what do they say about Amanda Knox when she was, you know, in Italy? They were keeping her up all night, berating her, telling her that she has AIDS, like quite literally. And then she's like, okay, my boss did it. Just please let me go. Yeah. Yeah, it's like the definition of a confession. Yeah.  Acquired. Yeah. And like, if you're just telling like some, you know, some like homosexual kid, like we are going to like charge you and like, you're going to be facing the death penalty if you don't give us something we can use. And then he gives you a false confession of a note that never existed and Like you then knowingly using that in the prosecution of another is like just doing harm to your case. Yes. Like giving him giving him a chance to get off for something that maybe he did just, you know, you don't have to fabricate evidence if you have him.  Yes. You don't have to fabricate evidence if you've got good forensic evidence, which they've at least claimed, which is DNA at the scene. They've claimed that. Palm print on the rifle. They've also claimed that. I mean, if you've got that, you don't need to be berating his homosexual boyfriend. I mean, you can just... yeah i mean get get the guy first and then you know establish that and then you can kind of move out to where there are accessories to this murder but um shaking down the people around him it it does actually seem like they're railroading him in fact uh pax you wanna oh pa is that you pax that just jumped in or  Oh, okay. Yeah, RFH, you can go first. Oh, no, sir. I didn't have anything to add there. I was just agreeing that, yeah, it does seem that they are just railroading this person. And you could have very well done it, but it might... It might really compromise a trial because I think someone was pointing out that Cash is on TV calling Charlie Kirk his friend and saying, don't worry, we're going to get him for you. You can't say things like that. You've got the watch, brother. See you in Valhalla.  Like this is like a big liability for a trial. You're putting this idea, there's like this massive bias and you're just railroading this person. And the defense will obviously jump on this. Like it's just completely bungled. But I guess that's what happens when you put podcasters in charge of the government. To add insult to injury, we're not even at the prosecution phase yet. The prosecution does not begin until after it passes the evidential test and the public interest test. But all that assumes that your prosecutor is free from pressure and influence. I mean, the weird situation got weirder and it's a clusterfuck. Yeah.  It's totally insane. Yeah, people are saying the DEI hire of Kash Patel. Is the fact that he's Indian more important than the fact that he was a massive Trump sycophant who denied the 2020 election and went on literally every podcast ever? Yeah.  Except mine. And I'm still broken up about that. But, like, it's not even that he's Indian. I think that's actually minor. Although it maybe adds a little spice to the whole thing. But it's that he's an insane Trump sycophant podcast bro who will defend Donald Trump at all costs, including when he shoots someone on Madison Avenue. Very unserious.  It's DEI for Magatards. Yes, that's what it is. The Valhalla comment, that is just so... fundamentally unserious it's like he has no brevity at all he can't just say i'll see you in heaven or you know to a largely christian rest in peace god bless you like it's so easy to just sort of say something no one would say that he's tampering with things but like we've got the watch brothers you  Is that literally from a movie? I don't even think he's really referencing the pagan idea of Valhalla. I think he's referencing Marvel movies.  Yeah. I think he's referencing like Thor, like the movie with, you know, Liam Hemsworth or Chris Hemsworth. Sorry. Yeah. Like that's what he's thinking in his mind because Mad Max Fury Road or something. Yes. Yes. Why is like a Hindu saying this to an evangelical? And it's not because he's actually thinking about like a Viking idea of like warrior heaven. He's, he's just, he's thinking about Marvel. Yeah.  Right. Well, there is Maga Valhalla. Like if you, if you die while podcasting, you get to podcast forever in like Maga Valhalla. I think, I think that is, uh, that checks out. That's in the prosetta. You're just interviewed by Joe Rogan all day. It never ends. Yeah. Just it's a podcast that never ends. You never get tired.  You never need a bathroom break. You're just talking to Joe Rogan for eternity. Yeah, it sounds... Only Gen Xers are able to enter this Valhalla. Correct. So other people... I'm sorry. You're just not... Yeah. You're not part of it. It's almost mockish of the idea of an afterlife. It's like he's almost mocking Charlie about what happened.  Yeah. I mean, if I were an evangelical, I'd be sort of offended. His offensive to an evangelical. As if Charlie Kirk died with a battle axe in his hand, dripping blood. That is an offensive idea to those people, of course. It reminds me of that terrible mural they did in Israel where they put him up with angel wings and kind of goofy. It's almost like a borderline caricature of Charlie. It doesn't quite cross that line, but it's almost like approaching it.  Let me just play this. That one is defensible, actually. That one's defensible because, uh, he is an Arian front man. He's a messenger of, of Yahweh in a sense. Yeah. Um, you could even argue he has become a Messiah than Joseph. Right. So. Yeah. Uh, let me just show this video just in case, um, uh we haven't seen it so someone else had a question here while i'm finding this um hi i didn't have a question i was just gonna say everything this like regime does is so marvel and uh it's like a hyper real regime like you would never see obama say oh i droned seven people today and have like a cool graphic over it so to me it's just like comic slop especially aimed at people who grew up like the same people that complain about like the truthfulness of their marvel slop or whatever if they change like a character it's the same type of people that are engaging with shit like that so  Okay. Yeah, let's just watch this because I do find this actually fascinating. I want to talk about a number of things, but I wasn't planning on watching this video. Let me just... Oh, the video has been taken down. Yeah.  I responded to it. Let me look here. I'll just start sharing my screen. I don't know. I don't want to waste time looking for stuff. That's like the worst television possible. I'll just find it. Okay. Which video is this? It's the one where he's... It's this one, it's maybe the most tasteless video I've ever seen because it includes a image of a POV shot of the assassination. And then it includes Charlie talking about as an angel in heaven and then it shows and then it's all this like pro-israel stuff it's just uh total madness let me you know i wonder if it was taken down if like the council of elders of the Jews were like, other Jews, like, this is really making us look bad. Please do not do it. They're like, the chief scientists were like, no, no, no, no, no. we will exploit his legacy tastefully tastefully um all right i'm not finding it oh this is it yes this is it oh my god okay here we go don't worry about me i'm in a better place now  But America and Israel, from this day on, will never be the same. This is the wake-up call. They tried to shut me up. They couldn't stand a voice that didn't sound like theirs. And that's exactly why we have to fight. We expose the lie. I spoke the truth, and they hated every second of it. I know you guys are hurting. It feels like you lost me. You didn't.  You can't kill an idea. You can't murder fake. Spirit doesn't break. Yeah. Wow, that was platonic. Those horrifyings. Platonic cringe. Yeah. No, he's like, the idea that the...  The idea never dies. The idea is beyond the material. Yeah, it is. That is definitely platonic. Yes. Shows how Plato has influenced all sorts of Christian and other sort of superstitious thinking. Yeah. It's also playing on this motif of, if you strike me, I will be more powerful than ever. Definitely. So...  Let me just talk about a few things. And I can definitely get some feedback on this, but, and I've said this before previously, so I might be repeating myself, but I want to say it again and again, get some feedback. So,  I do not think that Israel killed Charlie Kirk.  in some sort of black op situation. And the least I could say is that if I were Benjamin Netanyahu or some evil mastermind in the Mossad or wherever, I would not kill Charlie Kirk. In fact, I would desperately try to keep him alive. And  But I would grant that the situation is complicated. Now, when Charlie Kirk was murdered last Wednesday, Harrison Smith of Infowars... Retweeted a post from a month or so earlier about how Charlie Kirk was afraid of pushback from his donors. And on the Israel issue, and this seemed to get the ball rolling, so I remember people jumping on that right away. And then it started to metastasize and all of these different ways, and I have some videos in the scratch pad that we can watch to this effect. So. Max Blumenthal of the Grey Zone, which is, and I say this without any sort of hesitation, a Russian op. And has engaged in all sorts of nonsense and the true stuff that they say could probably be considered chicken feed.  They claim that Charlie Kirk was pressured by donors and that there was a $150 million  pledge that was dependent upon Charlie Kirk backing the genocide in Israel. And this was made by none other than Netanyahu himself. Netanyahu visited Charlie Kirk and said, dangled this before him, we've got 150 million, but  You got to play ball with us. And that would have doubled the size of Turning Point USA, which I've heard various numbers. I mean, you could probably look this up on their charity filings. $100 million organization, $150 million organization. Massive. But this would have doubled it.  There is zero evidence for this outside of the word of Max Blumenthal. And I don't trust that little man as far as I can throw him. Although, to be fair, I could probably throw him quite a ways. But you get my point. Richard, did you hear who his anonymous source was for that piece? Who? Chuck Johnson. blumenthal's and on has that been revealed yeah the uh the anonymous source close to charlie kirk that keep that he cites throughout that piece is chuck johnson i didn't notice that okay let me finish my rant here and then we'll go look at that in detail if you could put that in the chat i'll put that up okay  I need more than the word of Max Blumenthal. That is pure hearsay, rumor. I just need some sort of real evidence for this. Now, I remember there was an interview with Greta Van Susteren with Bibinet Yahoo after the death of Charlie Kirk, and she said, well, these rumors are all over the Internet. Did you kill him? What do you think? And I'll grant you that his body language is pretty bad. He was kind of all over the place.  His words and emotions weren't matching. Okay, but body language, that's not evidence for anything. I want to know this because the fact is someone like Max Blumenthal is highly motivated to perpetuate this kind of stuff.  because first off, he's a Russian asset. Who knows what they're up to? But also Max Blumenthal, perhaps to his credit, has been a longtime critic of Israel, well before October 7th and the Gaza bombardment, well before that. So he is highly motivated to say these kinds of things. And what he seems to be doing is that he's stealing Charlie Kirk's legacy.  Charlie Kirk's legacy, in my mind, is of conservative talking points and Christian Zionism. That is the fairest assessment of Charlie Kirk's legacy. If you want to honor Charlie Kirk, that's what you should be doing, because that's what he was ultimately about. So this idea of actors who hated Charlie Kirk for years and then now want to claim him as one of their own in death when he's not able to speak back, it's highly suspicious. Candace Owens has upped the ante, and I think we can even watch Candace speaking on this. And she's talked about Bill Ackman, I believe, talking to Charlie in the Hamptons and laying down the law and Charlie felt afraid and so on and so forth. And now she also claims all these people are scheming to take over TPUSA so it doesn't go anti-Zionist.  I just need some sort of evidence for this for me to believe it. And the words of Blumenthal and Candace Owens is not enough. Now, to be fair... I do think that there was a ambiguous situation going on with TPUSA, because this is the reality. You can look at polling. Conservatives are still strongly in support of Israel and strongly in support of the destruction of Gaza, ultimately, because that's ultimately what supporting Israel at this moment means.  The left has basically just taken a U-turn on this issue. There is dramatic falling of support for Israel. Now, among the young right, you also see a significant change, if not quite the change that we see among the left and even among mainstream liberals. So I think it's fair to say that within TPUSA, there are many people who are attending those conferences who are outright anti-Zionist or at the very least sort of America first types who don't, we don't want to get caught up in another war and blah, blah, blah.  And Charlie is feeling the pressure of that. Why? Because Charlie isn't Ben Shapiro. If Ben Shapiro were in charge of TPUSA, he would have nipped everything in the bud because Ben Shapiro is a pugilist like me, like Nick Fuentes, like other people. We want to get into fights with people because fighting is fun. If you want to argue with me about a movie, I'll get into a big, long, drawn-out fight with you because it's cool to argue and debate. That energizes us. Charlie Kirk, very different. Now, he'll debate the left...  There's no question. People who he is on the opposite side of, you know, abortion is wrong, change my mind. He will do that in which he is going to engage in this back and forth of platitudes. In terms of the right, he is a big tent people pleaser. He wants everyone to love him. And that includes Candace Owens. That includes Tucker Carlson. That includes Ben Shapiro. That includes Bibi Netanyahu.  That includes Matt Walsh, who's sort of on both sides of things. That includes the 19-year-old Griper who's working at TPUSA and creating Charlie Kirk hype videos that they can post on X. He wants to please all of those people. There are people like that. I am not one.  And he's like the camp counselor, the town mayor. This is who he is. And so there's no doubt that doing things like that focus group where you have a lot of young people and they're going anti-Israel, that he's having to deal with the situation. Now, to be fair, might Zionist bigwigs...  think to themselves, we don't want to even tolerate this stuff anymore. We want Ben Shapiro in charge, and he is just going to cut it out with a machete, just gone. Everyone on stage at TPUSA is pro-Zionist. We're not debating this issue, etc. Maybe. Maybe.  Maybe, but there's just no evidence of that. And I have a bit of a different view. If I were a Zionist mastermind in the upper layers of Mossad, I would actually like the dialectic. Why? Because you're ultimately going to neutralize the other side.  So look at all of these instances. Charlie Kirk doesn't want the Iran bombing to become another forever war in the Middle East. So he's going to go to Trump and say, no more forever wars. We don't like that stuff. We're America first. But then he supports the bombing anyway.  Even though bombing another country is the fastest way to get into a forever war. But he supports it and he'll Goldilocks it as, you know, just enough, not too much. Allowing all of those Groyper types into TPUSA.  Now, maybe at some point in the recent past, that would be a no-no. They would hunt you down and kick you out. But now it's a little bit different. You let them make hype videos for you. You let them buy tickets to your event. You let them scream and shout in the audience. while girls in bikinis are firing t-shirt guns at you, and you have a dubstep techno music blasting while Ted Cruz comes on stage. That's what those events are like, by the way, and I'm not exaggerating, I'm underselling them, in fact. Why? Because you're ultimately neutralizing them. TPUSA is a fan club.  It's a kind of rock concert for conservatives. And so the more people you get on the same page, the more people you can get to ultimately reluctantly agree to the bombing of Iran, say, or the continued support of Israel. because yeah we're american first but we just have to because muslims bad uh they're an aircraft carrier for us uh blah blah blah we've heard all those talking points  So I believe that, again, do I know what's in the mind of Bibi Netanyahu? God knows. Do I know what happened in those conversations between Bibi and Charlie Kirk that invariably occurred? Of course I don't.  But I can just put myself in their shoes. I would say, look, the support for Israel is collapsing across the board. We are in dire straits. Let's play this dialectical strategy where we sort of bring them in, give them a little recognition, use their talking points, do a little race baiting. We're good at that. We've been doing that for 60 years. but ultimately neutralize them and ultimately get them on Team Red, which was, is, and will be pro-Israel. So just to sum up, there is no evidence for this. The evidence that we have is coming from totally disreputable sources.  Infowars, Max Blumenthal, Candace Owens. And secondly, Charlie Kirk, to his dying day, believed that as a Christian, he wants to protect the holy sites where Jesus walked on water and turned water into wine and raised Lazarus.  He is not just strategically committed to Israel. He is religiously, emotionally, viscerally supportive of Israel. It is very, very hard to turn someone against Israel.  against Israel who's connected to it in this fashion. That's why they get them at the churches, they get them while they're young. It would be like trying to make someone hate apple pie or their hometown. It's hard to do something like that. It can happen, but maybe even if you turn on those first things, you're kind of, I don't know, maybe even a little mentally ill or something. I don't know. And then, so that's my other argument, is that Charlie Kirk, even if he's listening to people or arguing with people, would not turn. And then part D, the fourth part of this argument, is that there is a strategic benefit to allowing not too much, but just enough... rad, trad, griper-esque alt-right criticism of Israel within your movement so long as you close the doors of the big tent and lock them inside of it. That's my argument. RFH, you're able to respond. Anyone else can respond to it. Yeah, so obviously...  You don't think it's Israel. But I saw and I know we talked about this before. I saw recently that Nick is also floating the idea that this is somehow Russia connected. Did you see that? This wouldn't be the first time where I seem to influence the young man.  It wouldn't. Yeah, I saw some of these things. Let me go. You can keep talking. So I hate, it's such bad television when I'm like searching for things on the screen, but...  His argument is the Communist Party, American Communist Party, is that what it's called? ACP? ACP, yes. It used to be Communist Party USA or whatever. And that they have been deleting their channels, which I agree is suspicious behavior.  You're deleting multiple channels afterward. The other thing, I think he picked up on this, which I tweeted yesterday afternoon, which is that, isn't it interesting that Team Russia are all saying the same thing? And also, we can watch these videos that I have in the scratch pad. Tucker Carlson is out of one side of his mouth saying we should never politicize this or claim his legacy. And out of the other side of his mouth, clearly...  putting forth the Israel did it theory, just clearly doing it, just subtly doing it. Candace Owens, of course, does not know subtlety, so she is just full-throatedly saying that Israel did it and Ackman did it or whatever. It's interesting, if you notice patterns... you notice that when there's certain people who all get on the same page, almost like they have a memo. And Team Russia seems to have had a memo and seem to be pushing the same thing. Because, I mean, it's kind of strange just to jump on a narrative immediately. I mean, I know we live in the age of the hot take, but I mean, I have over and over said, I'm not convinced that Robinson did it. I don't know what happened.  I have questions.  They have narratives and they're saying the same thing, offering very similar stories. What's going on there? Is someone involved? I'm not Vladimir Putin or something. Is there some sort of little coterie of people who are all pushing the same line and they're in communication or they've even received a memo to push this line?  Makes you wonder. Yeah, I mean, another point to the Russian thing is that with the Samantha Rupino shooting with the 09A stuff, the one of the people in there that was in contact with her and seems to have been sort of grooming her to do this.  And then also tried to then pin it on me. He was actually a Russian national living in the UK at the time. And then he fled back to Russia during this as this was happening. So it does seem that there are these weird like Russian bad actors in these discord servers that. doing something I know they have a history of this with doing this on social media like some absurd percentage of these like Facebook groups in which these boomers were just like losing their minds during like the election in 2020 had like Russian origins as well like they were created by people in Russia so it does seem that that's just kind of how they operate in these weird enclosed spaces on social media where they then just cause people to kind of Go crazy, whether it's just your boomer aunt or some Zoomer incel on some discord who has like no IRL friends. So it seems that's how they work. Yes. Purgosian created the toll farm. He was also the leader of the Wagner group. and ended up in all likelihood getting killed himself by vladimir putin but the the warfare that pergosian was involved in with the wagner group that is direct kinetic warfare is running in parallel with the warfare that they do online it's just different and russia propaganda quote unquote is as i've been saying over and over it's not these videos where it's like russia good you know nato pat they do do those videos but i think that's like one percent or five percent of what they're really doing what they're really doing is just spreading chaos in the country and Yeah, to make your enemy's household messy, chaotic, bloody, that just clearly benefits you, if only as a distraction. Yes. and so they they do have a motive to do these things and secondly it aligns with what they've done in other areas they're pretty obvious like rt for instance which is obviously russian propaganda what did rt do did it just say russia good america bad constantly not really not exactly did it say you know  We have memo from Kremlin. Glorious leader Putin can fly now and stop bullets faster than locomotive. No, they didn't do that. What they did is that they had leftist, rightist conspiracy theories on to just talk about the news in a way that was going to break the brains of people over the age of 65. yes and i shouldn't even say that it's not just boomers who are like susceptible to this the the broken the brain the breaking of the brain of the zoomer generation i that's where it is actually right now yeah it seems boomers and zoomers most targeted  Okay, one at a time. Yeah, Hai, you've been holding your hand up, so you can go first. I'm just going to say this is a pretty long tradition, and it started from LaRouche, right? So Max Blumenthal, Ben Norton, Glenn Greenwald, big like sort of canaries for the left side.  circa the Syria issue, primarily around that time, you know what I mean? The WikiLeaks Syria issue, it sort of coalesced into an anti-Obama, anti-establishment Democrat nexus or whatever. Besides the case, ACP had most of its primary ideology from LaRouche. Because they were associated with the Schiller Institute,  And that was run by LaRouche's widow. This was literally in the conference. And a lot of their ideas, like LaRouche is just a very economical thinker. So he has ideas that go from here to there. I think he was like an influence for Dugan or Dugan was an influence for him, something along those lines, because he talked in the Russian Duma.  at one point. So he was associated with a lot of Russian intellectuals to foment a movement in America that would be like a capitalist socialist movement where you would basically have the destruction of the destruction of like most public property, like public common lands for the sake of the sort of social light UBI, it was just a very crazy sort of idea that probably was just there as a guiding point to get people on the left and the right to agree to some extent. I think the ACP angle is interesting because I know a lot of interlocutors from acp that actually go out and do outreach to primarily right the primarily the right they do less outreach to the left now because the left has sort of had a reaction and the people that they couldn't really control that defected to the acp the sort of fight has been done right right it's jackson hinkle left or right coded  He's currently he's going to the right. He used to be left coated. I'm not sure he was ever left. He used to be left coated before he became Jackson Hinkle. When he ran for office in Southern California or something, he was clearly a Bernie bro surfer dude, actually.  And from the moment he exploded on social media, I would argue that he was 100% right coded. And do you notice also they all are now like Christian?  Which is just the easiest way to get to conservatives. You just say you believe in God and they already love you. There was a video with Haas in which he was saying that Stalin and Mao are looking down on us from heaven.  hoping that we will continue our good work for the working class. Like, it's truly remarkable that you think Mao is in heaven. I mean, it's just...  Like, they are going after right-wingers. I remember it was MAGA communism was the notion. And I remember even some of them were going, like, Costco communism or something. They were, like, adopting the Costco family. I mean, they've dropped that, of course. But, like, that just kind of shows... where they're going they denied darwin uh which is very interesting uh jackson hinkle doesn't he he goes after darwinianism and there's a sort of i mean that's not going to appeal to the alt-right of old or something but that that definitely appeals to the religious right and and so on they talk about like working families and traditions to be communist is to be patriotic that was what um malfit was promoting malfit's much less uh good looking and and and intriguing as as hinkle and and even haas i guess  But he was an ideas man that was promoting these things. So they've had this like total rebrand. And I think they've been successful at the very least on foreign policy. I mean, how many boomers or magotards have retweeted Jackson Hinkle  Or watch to Jackson Hinkle livestream when he's talking about Russia and Putin. I bet a lot, actually. I think they've been fairly successful, in fact, pushing MAGA-tards and boomers towards Russia. What's interesting is that back in 2018-17, I was part of even a further left group that was more about like, do you remember the Donetsk People's Republic? Not necessarily the Russian one. There were a lot of differences in the Russian ideology and Givi and all of those other people who mostly just died out, right? So they were basically co-opted by the Russian movement. But essentially, Max Blumenthal and a lot of those other commentators would like sort of nudge, nudge, wink, wink at the whole Givi thing. And frankly, like Ukraine had won over them.  They killed Givi. And I think it's like just a revenge thing for them to celebrate the Ukraine invasion because of what happened in that interim. And also, I think with Jackson Hinkle and like all of these ACP guys, a lot of them the darwinian thing also appeals to muslims and also like catholics and it's preferably anti-racist like haas's like whole thing is oh anti-racist masculinism to an extent it's sort of like a it's a broader thing than even like the groiper thing right because you have to be a catholic in some ways to be a gripper  You just have to be anti-woke. Yes. But also some sort of like affected minority in the world to be like an ACP guy. Yeah, you have to be like vaguely... I don't think they like paganism. You have to be like sort of monotheistic and masculine. It even sort of...  dovetails or crosses over with like Hazan, who's one of the most successful Twitch streamers. But, you know, it's like, oh, I like work out and body build, but I'm also a communist and I also play video games.  Yeah, it's a weird thing. But where did Henkel originally come from? I can remember Henkel in 2020. And this is when I believe he was... No, no, no. He was claiming he was a Marxist-Leninist at the time. So this was after he was a Bernie bro.  which was 2016, 2017 era. Now he's a Marxist-Leninist, although you wouldn't know it really by what he says, but he just claims to be that. And there was this action that was associated with Jimmy Dore, also Team Russia, where they wanted, you know, we're in a pandemic and Nancy Pelosi needs to bring to the floor Medicaid for all right now. and we should hold off on endorsing her uh as she comes in uh to office until she promises to do that so and they were like we're playing hardball politics we know how it how it's doing but what it was was a kind of left action directed against liberals And after 2020, Hinkle was constantly talking about anti-woke stuff and constantly talking about Biden, Biden and NATO, Biden's war against Russia and so on. It's all directed against Democrats. And I think among other things, I mean, the Democrats were in power, of course, among other things, it was a way of picking in disaffected conservatives. and even if hinkle wants to criticize donald trump for overseeing the bombing or bombing of iran he just they just don't criticize trump like they criticize the liberals it's like they go after the liberals with so much more vehemence than they go after trump it's not really funny And so what is that outside of an attempt to kind of win over these people, win over the Groypers? Well, like I would say that a big focal point is that, for example, when you look at the left today, the people that are like so-called socialists only became socialists after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  they all sort of got radicalized into Instagram left politics. Like 2019, 2020, like all of a sudden, like this girl is like, you know, she shaved her head and now she's, you know what I mean? Like that's a sort of catastrophic radicalization. A lot of the old left felt very shafted by it because the old left,  whatever, was not as anti-white as people would think. So they were much more like you had Phil Greaves in Britain. You had a lot of other parties as well. And so it became this sort of cultural issue because the liberals started to radicalize into leftists.  And so they felt like, oh, they were taking over their turf, which might be true, but you know. Because the liberals were becoming, during the Great Awakening, the woke era, they were becoming sort of far left.  A little bit economically, but not really economically. It wasn't about wealth redistribution. It was more about power and sex redistribution, basically. But they viewed the liberals were being radicalized in a way. They were not becoming communist anymore. They were certainly they were not they were maybe even less interested in like tariffs and health care for all and all the sort of old style social Democrat issues. They were becoming activated on on the sexual in the sexual realm and in the identity realm and so on. And the the these this sort of new Communist Party reacted against that.  Yeah, in essence. And also some of the old left was particularly conspiratorial. I always say that the germ theory stuff really was germinated by the old left, like Cordilliers and Red Kahina. Cordilliers was a big funder of the old left, and he was sort of one of the first COVID deniers. right so you had yeah he's still if you go to his page you'll probably see like a lot of um right wingers following him but a lot of that because of the old old left that had already been splintered from you know whatever and the the word that the left would use for like this new movement of left liberals sort of hassan hassan fans right is like rad lips radical liberals mm-hmm Because that's what they want to do is to just recapture power without like actually, I don't really, you know. Yeah, it's interesting. Does anyone else have any comments? I was going to say something else about the Israel thing. Yeah, Play Called Italy. Just really briefly, I was just wondering if you saw that story about those two men with Arab last names, I think it was Nasir, who were caught trying to plant, I think they were like fake explosives under a news van in Magna, Utah, which I think is like a suburb of Salt Lake. I was just wondering if you saw that story. I can actually post it real quick. I wrote it in the comment section on the last video, but I can actually post it real quick  I just wanted to see what you thought about that. Like if that was some kind of, like if you do think it is some kind of Russian op or something, if it's some kind of, I don't know, squid ink to divert attention away from the Kirk incident and onto other stuff. That's crazy. So they were directly attacking the news media. yeah they they planted what i think it was like a fake ied under a news van and yeah and then they got caught and then the the feds like raided their house and then they insisted that the weapons were real but then they turned out to be fake and it was like two guys one was like 30 and the other one was like 50 there were like two arab guys like two guys with arab last names just a very and this happened on  Friday, I believe. So what was that two days after the shooting? So it's like very kind of, I just thought it was a very odd story that coincides with the assassination that I haven't really heard anybody talk about. I'll post it real quick. Yeah. Yeah, it does seem like squid ink, if I were just to guess, because you're not even doing the crime. You're just trying to basically create paranoia and anxiety. Let me just I'll just share the screen here. Two men arrested for allegedly planting lighting bomb under Utah news media vehicle near campus where Charlie Kirk was assassinated. Two men allegedly planted a bomb underneath a news van in Utah on Friday and tried to ignite it, sparking a massive evacuation federal probe. Adeeb Nazir, 58, and ideal justice on May Nazir, 31, were each arrested Sunday when authorities turned up at their front door in Magna, Utah, less than an hour away from the college where famed conservative pundit Charlie Kirk was assassinated. Wow. Um, the pair is accused of hiding an incendiary device found underneath the news media vehicle park next. Oh my gosh. Uh, yeah, I, I have, I have no idea what to make of this story. Yeah. And like I said, the weird part is, I think if you get to the end of the article, it turns out that the, the, the, the hardware they were claiming when the authorities got there,  The guys were claiming these were real bombs and they were not, apparently. They turned out to be fake. What would be the motivation for somebody, these two people, to do that? And then to find out they're fake. It's kind of odd. Maybe if they're being provocative, they're trying to plant the idea in right-winger's mind to bomb the liberal media or something. yeah or to possibly link this shooter to islamic terrorism i mean are they trying to put are they trying to someone trying to plant that idea in people's heads in utah that the kirk you know assassin is somehow linked to islamic terrorism well bb's been saying that no doubt um also oh this is interesting  This is actually fascinating. Someone posted this in, um,  in the chat. This is from Lamond. Pig heads at French mosque were left by foreign nationals, investigators say. A farmer in Normandy told investigators two people in a vehicle with what appeared to be Serbian number plates brought several pig heads, bought several pig heads from him, the Paris prosecutor's office said. They immediately left the country afterwards. Foreign nationals who immediately left the country are behind pigs' heads left outside the mosque in the Paris region. The city's prosecutor's office told Agence France Press on Wednesday, September 10th, citing a clear desire to cause unrest in France. Yes. They always escape as well. They do something and then they're gone. Like what RFH was talking about, the person who  was connecting her to a school shooter. Yeah, Charles Bousman shows up at J6, abandons his property and is in Russia a few days later. Yeah, it's their MO. This is interesting. Some people are... This is just out.  Okay, let me, um, let me go through this. I did want to talk about some other things, but oh, before I do this, let me just do a loose end on the whole Israel situation. So there's also this idea that if someone is a bad actor, a troublesome priest, let's say, someone who's pushing a little too hard here and there, that you would kill them with a sniper rifle in public like this is the assumption that people make with jfk with charlie kirk etc is that if they don't like you they're gonna put some patsy up in a sniper's nest somewhere in a book depository or on campus at utah valley university and he's gonna just blow your head off and that's how they do things The fact that the JFK murder in Dallas and the Charlie Kirk murder in Utah were public is not a bug, but the central feature of both events. And you really can't take that away from them. So if... Like, let's say that Charlie Kirk got red-pilled and now hates all Jews, and he told Bibi Netanyahu this. What's going to happen with Charlie Kirk? They might just dump him and take away all sorts of funding. They might put some bad stories about him in the news, uncover a dead prostitute in the trunk of his car.  claim that he's gay or who knows what they would do. If they were to kill him, they would do it in a fashion that's quiet and secret and plausibly deniable. So they would, he would fall out of a window, he would have a heart attack, get into a car accident. All of those things can be done.  That's the dark business of espionage is to kill someone softly as the song goes. What happened in Utah and what also happened in Dallas, I think we need to understand as grand spectacle. And you don't quite...  know how it's going to be taken. It's obviously going to create chaos and opinions on all sides, but it is theater on some level. I mean, JFK was murdered in a parade while driving in downtown Dallas through Dealey Plaza, waving at people, waving at fans.  The shock is not incidental. The shock is perhaps, even in the JFK case, the main event. It's the fundamental motive is to create that shock. Charlie Kirk was murdered publicly before hundreds of people live streaming it, before thousands of people gathered, before millions of people watching it around the world.  It was meant to be a spectacle. So he was, in a way, meant to be martyred. He wasn't just taken out because he had some bad opinions or had a falling out with Netanyahu or whatever. He wasn't taken out. He was martyred live on stage. Now, you can take that in all sorts of directions. Was it a warning to others? Oh.  Maybe. I think the fundamental issue is that he was martyred. And if someone were planning this act, and so what we're watching is high-level theater on a geopolitical scale, they would understand that he is going to be seen as a fallen saint by people. That he is going to become much bigger than he ever was.  by being killed. If Charlie Kirk got into a helicopter accident or had a heart attack or something like that, he would certainly be remembered fondly, but he would not be this new kind of meta-political memetic force that he's become. So this is yet another reason why I don't buy the story being spun by Tucker, Candace, Max Blumenthal, et cetera, is that they're treating this like an assassination as opposed to understanding it properly as grand theater and martyrdom.  So they're thinking that Israel must have hated Kirk and that's why they got rid of him. That's not the right way to think of it. In a way, Israel is loving Kirk in the sense that they are making him a myth and not a man by doing this. So why would they want to be doing that if he's about to turn on the Jews? It's just...  I don't know. That's just another thought about why I don't buy the Israel situation, but. Let's go to this is like breaking here. Yeah, Ken Klippenstein, he always gets all this stuff. It's fascinating. Okay, exclusive leaked message messages from Charlie Kirk's Charlie Kirk assassin accused shooters politics is not what government and media say. This is kind of remarkable it's like leaked first on sub stack.  Hey, guys, I have bad news for you all. It was me at UVU yesterday. Thus, Tyler Robinson messaged his friends on Discord, seemingly apologizing for murdering Charlie Kirk. I'm sorry for all of this. I obtained this and other Discord chats I've decided to publish. The legacy news media, as usual, refuses, along with new information I've learned about Robinson from the people who knew him best.  Okay. Wow. Okay. So this is September 10th. This is the day of 3 17 PM. Charlie Kirk got shot dead. I just saw the video. Holy shit. RIP. I guess bro didn't deserve to go out like that. This is interesting. This is indicating that these are, uh, certainly kind of more normal people. They're not reveling in. the matter and then here is september 11th 2025 hey guys i had bad news for you all it was me at uvu yesterday i'm sorry for all of this i'm surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments thanks for all the good times and laughs you've all been so amazing thank you all for everything that that type of casual flippant attitude just to strike me as strange This could be one chat room that he's in that you can have multiple of these servers and maybe these are his video game friends and not really his crazy leftist trans friends. Very true. Just something to keep in mind.  Definitely. Trump and company portray the alleged Utah shooter as left wing and liberals portraying him and liberals portray him as right wing. The federal conclusion will inevitably be that he was a so-called nihilist, violent extremist, NVE.  I have heard that category thrown around. I think that that fits what we were talking about two weeks ago with the Minneapolis killer. I mean, it's, I think it's, it's, it's wrong to say left or right wing, you know, he, what did he say? Nuke India, kill Trump, 6 million more.  Hey nigga, like it was just this like constellation of memes and ideas that don't fit together.  Um, meanwhile, the crackdown has already begun. As they reported yesterday, the country is practically ready to go to war. Yeah, it's not wrong. It's been so terrible and seeing it from an inside perspective is so frightening. A friend of Robinson since middle school told me the childhood friend who asked not to be named for fear of threats provided me with the above non-public public photo of Robinson on a camping trip, a favorite activity of his to cooperate their relationship. Wow. Wow.  that does look like the shooter right there. And yeah, there's somewhere in that does look like some national parks in Utah. Wow. Um, I think the main thing that's caused so much confusion is that he was always generally apolitical for the most part, the friend said. That's the big thing. He just never really talked politics, which is why it's so frustrating. That also aligns with going to Utah State to study STEM  And dropping out to join a trade school where you're studying electrical engineering. uh the picture that emerges bears little resemblance to the media version robinson i am told the quiet was a well-liked person with a supportive family that also does align with the the photos you know we're just reading into photos but he did seem like he had a good relationship with his father and mother jf was saying that that might very well have been masking  which is very interesting, but at least on the surface level, they seem very friendly. The friend group who we interacted with on Discord, far from some kind of militia camp or anti-faw bunker, it's been portrayed as, represented a range of different political views, but mostly talked video games. Yesterday, FBI Director Kash Patel said in an interview that Robinson subscribed to left-wing ideology, citing his family's remarks to investigators. But those close to Robinson say there was a lot his family didn't know about him. Their ideas are based on someone they didn't fully understand, the childhood friend told me. Though the family was generally supportive of Robinson, a claim corroborated by his mother's Facebook account brimming with praise for Tyler, they didn't seem to know about his relationship with a transgender person named Lance, the friend said. When I ask if his family would have been accepting, the friend replied, I don't think even Tyler knew the answer to that question, which is why he kept it so low-key between themselves. Tyler's bisexuality, the friend said, was coupled with openness on LGBT issues. But his wasn't some cookie-cutter leftist position on every or even most issues, his friend said. Obviously, he's okay with gay and trans people having a right to exist, but also believes in the Second Amendment, the friend said, referring to the right to bear arms. The friend described Robinson as fairly typical of a young man his age from Utah, someone who loved the outdoors, was a gamer, and into guns. To all of us, he just seemed like a simple guy who liked playing video games like Sea of Thieves, Deep Rock, Galactic, and Helldivers 2. Loved to fish and loved to camp, the friend said. It really did seem like that was all that he was about. And the gun casings quote Helldivers...  The phrase inscribed on one of the bullet casings from the shooting. Yeah. Okay. Hey, fascist catch the widely reported to mean he was a man of the left is in fact a reference to hell divers to video games, three arrows initially believed to be federal by federal agents to be a reference to Antifa. Those are the three downward arrows are also a reference to hell divers. Private discord messages shared with me by a friend of Robinson confirmed that Robinson wasn't some political martyr. a search for posts of robinson's containing keywords like biden and trump turned up just one hit each the trump post was a passing reference to the 2019 impeachment inquiry the biden one came on the day of the 2020 election where he provided an update to another friend asking about the status of the vote count so zealous monkey is that tyler  An impeachment inquiry has been placed against Donald Trump. He could get booted out if they find he committed the shit he's accused of.  Who is winning the election? Would you know Biden is in the lead electoral votes? Okay, so this is just to demonstrate the innocuousness of all this. The childhood friend is a member of multiple discord chats with Robinson. He described the group as trying to grapple with Robinson's motive just like everyone else. Even the goodbye message he sent in one of our servers where discord chats are hosted was so hard to believe we all just thought what a weird joke to make.  Then the news came out. We all were calling each other saying, check the news. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what makes a person like him decide he's going to drive 260 miles upstate to shoot someone like Charlie Kirk, then come back like nothing happened. It leaves a lot of room for speculation and theories, which is why I think they're so rampant. Fair enough. Part of the confusion he attributes to Tyler's quiet nature.  He was a really smart guy, but super hard to read. Stone cold poper face. And you could always never be confident assuming anything. Does that strike you as... autism rfh or maybe psychopathy it it feels autistic to me um people keep pointing out this uh we keep seeing this like weird chin to philtrum ratio on these shooters lately like the last three all have the same sort of face what describe it  So their chin is really large and the philtrum is a space between your nose and your lips. And that's really shortened on them. So they all have like their chin. Yes, their philtrum is shortened and their chin is elongated. We've seen this in the last three mass shootings now. It's kind of crazy. It's probably indicative of some sort of...  It might be correlated with autism or maybe psychopathy. I don't know. It is interesting that they all kind of have this very distinct facial feature. It's almost like a Habsburg jaw. Interesting. So they are having a very... Yeah. I guess mine is pretty average, obscured by my mustache. Yours is normal. Yeah.  They all have these really distinct weird faces. You see it immediately. Yeah, might be. The kid who took the shot at Trump also had that sort of long trigger. Right. It was Crooks, and then the Minneapolis shooter, the last one that killed those kids at the Catholic school, and now Robinson all have this.  That's fascinating. If someone could find an image of that and just post it in the chat, that would be interesting. Yeah, there's some posts about it on Twitter. I can try to find it. Let me just go to Twitter, actually. If you type in chin filter ratio, it should come up. A lot of people have been talking about it.  Yeah, I found it. Yeah. Did you find it there? Yeah. Yeah. That is a very... So it's not even necessarily the size of the philtrum. It's just the really long chin, which creates the ratio. The ratio, yeah. That is true. That's something I sort of perceived of why is that person goofy looking? Yeah. Or why is he creepy looking? Yeah. And maybe there's, it's that it's something that cause your, your, your eyes are ready to perceive something normal and it, and it sort of is, is jarring. Um, that is fascinating. Yeah. Interesting.  Let's just watch this guy. So we see he has a recessed chin, prominent, prominent recession. We also see he has a short ramus and a very downgrown mandible. And this really presents in the front profile. We see how his chin is so much taller than his philtrum. This looks to be around five to one. So we need a counterclockwise double jaw surgery to correct that. We see his jaw is around 80% of the width of his face, which this is an ideal. Ideally, we want this 84% at the very low end. So he has a narrow jaw.  His canthal tilt is not looking too good, bit negative. He has a strabismus. His eyes are looking different ways. That's a classic indicator of someone's a bit out of their mind, not gonna lie. The hairline is out of sorts. The hair density is horrible. The eyebrows are not laterally long enough. We can see they only really go out to not even- Okay, this is literally a look smacking video. it is all right i find this just a little he he's like so i i'm fine with the analysis but what he's trying to say is if you want to meet women in prison you need to get plastic surgery yeah um okay that's just kind of goofy under that other post there's a chart in the replies the second yeah see that one yeah it's of a bunch of shooters and their chin to filter ratios  And not trying to muddy the water here, guys, but have we looked at Captive Dreamer's picture? Because he as well has a pretty deep chin. Yeah. Interesting. That is interesting. Yeah, not trying to be weird or anything, but... Yeah. I think there's something off about someone i mean it's one thing to make weird jokes um it's it's just you know look at how do you fantasize about yourself you know ricky vaughn i'm forgetting what his actual name is at the moment douglas yeah matt douglas mackie correct yeah He fantasized himself as Ricky Vaughn from Major League, wearing a Trump hat, who, granted, was a criminal, but obviously a lovable criminal in the movie. A little bit edgy, not really that edgy. Imagining yourself as David Koresh, isn't that the person, the Captive Dreamer? Yes, it's David Koresh with a MAGA hat, I believe.  Okay, so you're a Trump cultist, as he describes. You were involved in a brutal raid by alcohol, tobacco, and firearms and the FBI in which children died. And you are a messianic sex cult leader. Mm-hmm.  It's also interesting. Koresh, there's another piece to that, though, with Captive Dreamer. Koresh was...  was having like relations or like marrying minors, like the children of. Oh yeah. That's what I was mentioning. Yeah. Having sex with their wives and, um, and abusing children. Yeah. Yes. And Captain Dreamer loves posting about how there shouldn't really be age of consent laws, uh, or that they should be like massively lowered to like, I don't know, 14 or something. So there's just a lot he seems to idolize about Koresh. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, it's extremely odd. It's interesting how that developed from Ricky Vaughn, which is sort of jokey and fun, to something that's much creepier and cult-like just over the period of seven years. Yeah. Let's go back to this Klippenstein piece. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just saying the stone cold poker face, the lack of affect is something you associate with psychopaths. Also autism. Also autism. But, you know, wouldn't you agree, RFH, that every autist is really a psychopath? Psychopaths are autists. uh no i don't think so i they're obviously different things um yes uh but yeah we could analyze that but that is interesting that that's the first thing that comes to mind with someone um he's stone cold poker face yes  When I asked if he opened up to anyone, the friend replied, as far as we know, he was open. As far as we knew he was opened up. As far as we knew he was open. That's a weird phrase.  Okay. Despite his verbal reticence, Robinson was not a loner, according to his friends. Unlike the stereotypical outcast shooter driven to violence by social rejection, he was apparently amiable and well-linked. It's also interesting. Everyone who knew him liked him, and he was always nice, a little quiet and kept to himself mostly, but wasn't a recluse, the childhood friend said. Regardless of the horrible actions that took place, we must take this moment to remember that God is a living and loving God who loves all his children. A Discord post from another friend posted the day after the shooting reads... While Charlie Kirk's politics were not acceptable to some, I ask that we all say a prayer for him and his family during these confusing times. This does not sound like some nihilistic, dungeness chat room. This sounds like a Mormon chat room. It does. Or evangelical, but in this case, they're in southern Utah, so I guess Mormon, yeah.  Um, so this is nine 12. Uh, so I guess two days after the shooting, uh, Hey everyone, if you have not seen the news yet, Tyler's post above it. True. Okay. Is true. I guess he, he was taken into custody earlier today for the shooting of Charlie Kirk, regardless of the horrible actions that took place. We must take this moment to remember that God is a living and loving God who loves all his children. God calls centers to be his saints. Um,  And I ask that you all take a quiet moment to pray for Tyler and his repentance. Okay, that's creepy. This is creepy. Now, maybe it's unintentional, but this is creepy what's implied by that paragraph. While Charlie Kirk's politics were not acceptable to some, I ask that we all say a prayer for him and his family during these confusing times. Love you all. God bless. Okay. Regardless of the horrible actions that took place,  We must take, okay, so he's putting the murder aside. We must take this moment to remember that God is a living and loving God who loves all his children. Now that would include Charlie, that would include Tyler. God calls sinners to be his saints. Whom is that referring to? Is that referring to Tyler?  I believe so. So Tyler send murder. That's one of the big ones I've heard. To be his saints. I think because they're LDS...  I mean, it could also just be like all of everybody's a sinner. You know, we are all, we have all sinners. I get that. I get that. Like we're all sinners here. You know, even the best of us are, I get that. But in this context, this is quite creepy though. This is the thing about statement analysis is it's okay. You have a million, you have tens of thousands of different words you can choose for anything and  You can put those words in millions of different orders. Why did you choose this one? This strikes me as creepy, actually. And maybe I'll learn other things and I'll realize that I'm reading too much into this. This strikes me as he's saying that a sinner is called to be a saint. It's like a justification for this on Mormon grounds. That's what I'm reading. And then he says here, and I ask that you all take a quiet moment to pray for Tyler and his repentance. Now, repentance strongly implies that this was bad. I think it's because they're LDS. Saints refers to members as faithful followers of Christ. They don't actually mean like a saint. Okay. I think it's like a Mormon thing.  They call all Mormon saints? Yeah, it's just referring to members of the church, it looks like. Okay. Well, maybe, okay, I might be wrong. That struck me as very creepy. Yeah, I think it's just a weird Mormon thing. This is just how they speak. At the very least, this is indicating that this community was very Mormon-y. Yes, and not anti-Farm.  Not Antifa or trans nihilist. Yes. This is not a trans, a transsexual nihilist did not write this. That is clear. But this is not Tyler, but this is a friend in his chat room. Yeah, go on.  these are kids he played video games with that he probably knew all his life from the church. Like he's not espousing his like radical leftist trans ideology to these people. He just wants to like log on and play video games with these. Like there could very well be another chat room where he does his like fed posting. Yeah, totally. That makes a lot of sense, but these kids were not like privy to that side of him, you know?  Did you see the text that released today between him and the boyfriend?  No, put that in the chat. I'll put it in the chat right now. Let me finish reading this. We just have a little ways to go, and I feel like since we started it, we should complete it. The last message is religious in nature, which just goes to show the apolitical nature of the server.  We all have... Oh, there's an assumption built into that. We all have pretty different views on politics, the friend said on the Discord post. We all just exist as friends and just play stuff. Cat memes, weather updates, home improvement, and the odd Garfield reference populate Robinson's post. I'm going to eat pretty soon. Very eepy, he said in one post. An intentionally silly misspelling of the word sleep. A common Gen Z convention. Can Gen Z please stop doing this? i say ep ep yeah i mean sleepy why i don't know it's cute i'm ep yeah it's just disturbing uh bed bug e inspector bed bouge inspector  I just don't understand this world. I feel like Tommy Lee Jones at the end of No Country. It says gullible on the ceiling. No idea what any of this means.  This is just like spring in southern Utah. Like, ha, ha, ha, it snows here. Yeah, you see a lot of that in Montana. Had to replace a monitor that was on a wall mount, the top two mount. Yeah, this is just, I know the feeling. Yeah.  Wow, just very innocuous stuff. The federal government, the Washington crowd, and corporate media based in Washington and New York see the country in wholly partisan terms. Republican versus Democrat, red versus blue, old media versus social media, liberal versus conservative, right versus left, straight versus gay, and on and on. Charlie Kirk's assassination in Utah should remind us of the actual diversity of the nation.  And of the cost of polarization that demonizes the other side. Okay, thanks for the sermon. No one in Robinson's group is cheering or justifying the murder in any of the messages I reviewed. They're just struggling to understand what their friend did. But Washington has become obsessed with the Discord chat, convinced it's some kind of headquarters for the murder and cauldron of radicalization and conspiracy. Today, FBI Director Patel vowed to investigate anyone and everyone on that Discord chat. What I see is a bunch of young people shocked, horrified, and searching for answers like the rest of the country. That is fair enough, but the problem is that Jeffrey Dahmer probably had a good relationship with his barista. It's irrelevant, and it is worthwhile looking into this and demonstrating that that server, where they got the confession from,  is not a radical edgy server. Okay, that's fair enough. Now, what does that mean? Is he more or less likely to confess to his gamer friends, normie friends? I don't know. But I think Kleppenstein is giving us some sermon there at the end that I don't really appreciate. I think you should just shoot straight when you're claiming to be a journalist. Okay, so this is...  Okay. Text exchange. So this came out, this is today, just about 50 minutes ago, apparently. Okay. Text exchange between Tyler Robinson and his trans boyfriend after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.  Okay, that's a mugshot of Tyler. That is Lance Twiggs, who went by Luna. I think they're just gay. I don't even think that that guy's a trans. This is what a lot of people have pointed out as well. The other thing, in the video in which he's doing this innocuous video and unboxing or something like that, he had a very deep voice for whatever that's worth.  Yeah. That is associated with testosterone or just simply being larger. But anyway, judging from today, I'd say grandpa's gun does just fine. I don't know. I think that was a 2K scope. So he spent. Wow. So he spent $2,000 on a scope. robinson delete this exchange robinson my dad wants photos of the rifle he says grandpa wants to know who has what the feds released a photo of the rifle and it's it is very unique he's calling me right now not answering wow holy shit  My dad wants photos of the rifle. Okay, he says grandpa wants to know who has what. So his grandpa seems to have been worrying that someone might have used his rifle for something. Since Trump got into office, my dad has been pretty diehard MAGA. Robinson said this, Robinson. I'm gonna turn myself in willingly. One of my neighbors here is a deputy for the sheriff.  Robinson, you are all I worry about love. Roommate, okay. I'm much more worried about you. Robinson, don't talk to the media, please. Don't take any interviews or make any comments. If any police ask you questions, ask for a lawyer and stay silent.  Okay, that's good advice if you're guilty. I mean, I think there are people who will tell you never talk to the police ever. You know, I'm not like that. I think if you did not do anything, cooperation is a good idea. If you start not cooperating and you are innocent, that's going to... make them quite suspicious of you, by the way, and might lead to you being charged with obstruction of justice. So I think reasonably cooperating with the police is a good idea. Obviously, if you're guilty, excuse me, then don't talk to them. That is definitely true, but I hate giving advice to guilty people.  The only crime anyone in this community would commit is speeding. So a little tip. If you're caught speeding, don't just be like, I was driving at a reasonable rate of speed. Don't say, I was driving 70. That's what people always do. They'll lie but not lie too much. So they'll be like, they were driving 80, but they'll be like, I was driving 70. All you've done is admit to a crime because you're already speeding. Anyway, I'll drop this.  After reading the note, the roommate responded, what? You're joking, right? Okay. What is this? After reading the note, the roommate responded, what? You're joking, right? I don't understand. I guess they're referring to the note that Kash Patel is talking about? That's what came to my mind. But what is that? Is that like, this is not a direct transcription. This is just...  Like, commentary? Let me see. Okay, I'll just leave that aside and keep reading. Robinson, I am still okay, my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you. He wanted to kill Charlie Kirk, get away with it, and die of old age on his deathbed, admit that he was the one who did it. This does stress me as psychopathy. As many will tell you, psychopaths all believe that they are going to get away with the perfect crime and that they are the mastermind murderer. Some of them are.  Most of them aren't. But it's interesting that he thought that he was going to get away with it and keep it secret. And then roommate. You weren't the one who did it right. I am. I'm sorry. Okay. That is a confession. And this also indicates that the roommate didn't know. Yes. Yes.  And then the roommate, I thought they caught the person. No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing. I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. It's quiet, almost enough to get out, but there's one vehicle lingering. Okay, now... So he must still be in Utah Valley University, the area around the college here, because he's like a two and a half hour drive away. Roommate, why? Robinson, why did I do it? Yeah.  I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out. We heard that little clip, I think, even yesterday.  If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence. Ooh, buddy. It's not... Earlier in this exchange, hadn't he already said that he was going to turn himself in? Like, this timeline seems all... I wonder if these were posted in the reverse order. We can see if... Someone in the comments is saying it's in reverse order. Okay, that makes sense.  Yeah. Going to attempt to retrieve it again. Hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it. How long have you been planning this? A bit over a week, I believe. I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't want to chance it. um robinson i'm wishing i'd circle back and grabbed it as soon as i got to my vehicle i'm worried what my old man would do if i didn't bring back grandpa's rifle oh my god you sh do you think there's some psychological significance with killing charlie kirk with grandpa's rifle  I don't know. I assumed it was just the most readily available gun around, like a rifle that he could shoot from far away like that. But he said it had unique character on it, so that's so stupid. yeah that is like some ode to uh kind of like you know killing off the boomer mentality or boomer um thinking that you know charlie had old views like you know the old days yeah like that but it's almost like his grandfather is symbolically killing charlie kirk i don't know um i'm just speculating You would think if you intend to get away with it, you would have enough forethought to not use a rifle that could be traced back to you. Exactly. You'd buy one at a pawn shop or a gun show, steal one. Right. That's like a level of delusion. Yes. Also, the whole thing of stashing it just strikes me as creating more variables...  I'm wishing I'd circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle. I'm worried. Why did you stash it? I guess to get to your vehicle, you wanted to stash it.  So that no one would see it with you in the car. And then you'd go back and, okay, that does make a sense. But I guess if I were involved in some sort of crime like this, don't you want to limit variables? You're just creating more ways to get caught by doing this stuff.  I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpa's rifle. I don't, I-D-E-K, I think he meant I don't know if it had a serial number, but it wouldn't trace to me. Yeah, but it would trace to your grandfather. Yeah. presumably i mean you thinking i worry about prince i had to leave it in a bush where i changed outfits didn't have the ability or time to bring it with i might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prince how the fuck will i explain losing it to my old man only thing i left was the rifle wrapped in a towel i  Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fucking messages are mostly a big meme. If I see notices bulge on Fox News, I might have a stroke. All right, I'm gonna have to leave it. That really fucking sucks. Um...  Okay, let me just say this. The boyfriend is complicit in not turning him in once he admits to the murder. Okay, let me just say this. I'm sorry. Does this strike you as an orgy of evidence? He's admitting to it. Have you ever seen Minority Report? Minority Report, we should do a REM analysis on that at one point, but it's... uh the colin farrell's character who's who's catholic and he's chasing after the murderer there at one point he walks in and there's a dead body and all these photos on the bed or whatever he said this is an orgy of evidence  How many times in my career have I seen an orgy of evidence? The idea is never. It's too much. I'm just saying this explains a lot. Now, you could take that in two ways. You could say, okay, well, I'm glad a lot of these reasonable questions that people had have been cleared up. You could also say, isn't this a bit much? Isn't this kind of an orgy of evidence? That he's explaining things too explicitly and it ties up all the little pieces that we didn't quite understand. Yeah, it feels a bit convenient. And the FBI did bungle a lot. Yeah.  I'm – it's – and isn't this – now, look, intelligent people can be delusional. That's obviously true. No comment on that one, I guess. But aren't you just – like, wouldn't you just assume in this day and age that – They're going to sweep the Discord server that you're on, and you have just clearly admitted to murder. I don't know. These aren't the goings-on of somebody who intended to get away with it. At least in part of this exchange, he's just already... He's already going to turn himself in, so I guess he doesn't care anymore. He's realized it's too late or something, so... I don't know. I... I'm just going to say, just due to the fact that Cash Patel has been trying to... First off, he's just a suspicious person, dubious person to begin with. But that he's bungled this, his job is threatened. I don't know. There's part of me that just doesn't believe this. I'm just going to be honest.  Now, if there is some other evidence, if in a little bit under an hour, this guy pleads guilty,  Okay, but I don't know. I'm more inclined to believe that Tyler Robinson did this. I'll also admit that over the weekend, I was going down some rabbit holes on second shooters that were nearby. Was it a pistol round that hit him? And I just have questions. I don't know what to say, but I'm more inclined to believe that Tyler Robinson did this as more evidence is presented to me. um but this is i don't know there's just a little you know devil on my shoulder saying this is too convenient a lot of people were saying that in the replies actually to this post that it reads as if it's scripted i mean i wouldn't put it past them because they have done such a bad job here and it feels like they need to like make it work now yeah  And obviously you said Cash is desperate. But if they were to script it, wouldn't these bozos be like trans rights? She'll reign supreme in Utah now that the evil Kirk has been destroyed. Hail Satan. Hail Satan, lover. It seems like they would have made it Okay, now, on the other hand, if I saw something like that, I would be like, alright, this is fucking fake. Then you'd really know. Yes, I think that's too obvious. So maybe they're not completely stupid. They're pretty dumb, but they're not that dumb. Pax? Are we ever going to see photos of those engravings? Or do they plan to release those? oh yeah if there's a trial they would most definitely release them do you know or if does anybody know if doing engravings on brass is difficult or it's a good question um brass is very soft metal yeah i mean brass is even softer than bronze which it's similar to which is softer than steel  I think he could do it. Did Luigi do that? Did he put messages on the bullets? He put messages on the bullets, but that on the casings of the bullet. Did he write those or something? What? Yeah, I don't know. He definitely put messages. Yeah, I just can't remember if it was on the casings like this. I think it was. Mm-hmm.  Wow. Well, it's funny. This case is developed in real time and we've been able to react to it. It's good stuff. I think there's new info. The only thing just to say, it does feel like they're sort of spoon feeding us the narrative and almost like reacting to things do you know what really bothered me of after reading the note the roommate responded what so he left a note oh okay hold on let me just go back to this because it's that part's not in quotes so i think that that is just the person writing this saying that the roommate read the note and then it has quotations as if that's the text message that he then sent in response to seeing that note  After reading the note, the roommate responded, what? You're joking, right? So, okay, is this what happened? Tyler left a note for Twigs that said he did this, and did Twigs destroy the note? I think that's what occurred. Okay. Okay. And maybe, I guess what Cash is saying is that they literally just bullied him into admitting there was a note. That's what it sounds like. Right. Yeah. Wow. So... yeah this is someone it's funny these replies this reads like someone pretending to be tyler and making sure they include all of the main speaking points yeah hmm  So this is legit. I'm not just reading some crazy, breaking 911, 1.2 million followers, okay? Yeah, it's funny. A lot of people are reaching the same conclusion as I have. I mean, just to reiterate, I'm more inclined to believe that Tyler did it, but there's something... That exchange is just too convenient. Pax? Yeah. I just find the engraving strange because if he wanted to get away with it, he's using a bolt-action rifle. I mean, he could have fired and not cycled another round. He could have just fired and then just took off. You know what I mean? So if he planned on not getting caught, then what's the point of engraving brass casings?  Am I making sense there? Yes, because a bolt, unlike, say, an automatic pistol where the shell is going to be kicked out, a bolt-action rifle, we all know that, you open the bolt and remove the casing after the firing. So there's no need for any casing to be left behind. He could have just engraved one bullet with some message and then cycled around and just left it there to be like, oh, this guy was ideological. But again, if you don't want to get caught, then don't do that.  Why is he drawing people to his Discord server where they play Hellraiser or whatever it is? Hell... What is it called again? Helldivers. Helldivers, yeah. Why is he referencing Helldivers? Like, yeah, it sort of throws people off. People don't know what to make of that. But then you're also... I mean, a lot of people play this game... surely but like you're connecting it with your discord server yeah i mean if you want to get away with something then leave as little evidence as possible and um  I don't know. If this were a professional job, I could even imagine someone leaving the rifle at the scene, running in the chaos, getting into a car, getting into a plane, changing costumes, which Tyler did, and just in that 15 minutes of total chaos before they're able to establish a perimeter, get away with it. um that's what you would do but it would have to not be a gun tied back to you you know that's why you would exactly shop or you yeah a gun from a pawn shop just drop it get it get it out of your uh get it off your person and get as far away from it as possible don't put it somewhere and then go visit it yeah no that's that's insane I mean, there is the whole like psychological aspect of like these people, like on some level they want to get caught for these crimes because they want to be, you know, this strikes me as like something like that where ostensibly he like on some like subconscious level is doing these things that are going to cause him to be caught. Yes. Yes.  Wow.

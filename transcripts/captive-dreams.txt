All right. I hope everyone is doing well. As Hunkle noted, there's a rare Hunkle cameo appearance. Are you down in the Amazon dungeon working with the robots? Yeah, I'm usually asleep. Oh, you're asleep. No, I'm supposed to be sleeping for my next torture session. I thought you rose at the crack of them. But I just...  No, I usually wake up at around 4. Oh, wow. Do you work at Amazon like in three hours? Sorry, I'm sleeping. Or are you just a bohemian? Yeah, I work maybe a little bit of both. Okay. Visuals from 6 to 4.30 a.m. Oh, wow. Wow, those are some hours. I wanted to talk a little bit about the dogs.  Oh, good. OK. Yes. We will talk about the docs. Why don't we just start? Yeah, I want to delay you. Let's get started. OK. Yeah. No, I'll get started here. Are you hearing me? I feel like I'm talking to you in some delay fashion, like I'm on a spaceship and it takes, like, 10 seconds for the message to get there. OK. um just my brain i'm like just in the brain fog sleep deprivation mode wow okay um that will make your commentary all the more interesting i'm sure so rfh you're here as well and yes welcome as usual  OK, let's just jump on it and I'll try to set it up as objectively as possible. There is a character on the Internet named Captive Dreamer.  And he was, I think it's fair to say, highly influential over the past two years. He at least claims to have been the first one to promote the lie of Haitians eating cats in Ohio.  Congratulations. And that got the year of J.D. Vance. J.D. Vance actually follows Captive Dreamer. I can offer some more caustic commentary on Captive Dreamer. His actual name is Martin. Isn't that correct? That's his last name. That's his last name. Right. OK. Something Martin. jeffrey but it's spelled like joffrey i assume it's actually he says yeah i assume he goes by jeffrey though by jeffrey yeah it's the g-e-o-f-f-r-e-y variation yes yeah  Yeah. As Amalek pointed out or need more Amalek. Yeah. Point out in the chat. He he emerged as the Ricky Vaughn of 2024. Now, Ricky Vaughn or Douglas Mackey is his real name.  Did it first, I would say. And I think Captive Dreamer is a pale counterfeit of Ricky Vaughn, in fact. But I agree with that assessment. He was the Ricky Vaughn of 2016. And that's very interesting. So Ricky Vaughn would post, post, post, post, post. This was also at a time in Twitter history where having... 20,000 followers was like a huge thing, particularly on the far right and particularly as an anonymous account. Like you're, you're not Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher or all these Twitter heroes of yesteryear. Probably the younger people don't even remember that, but, um,  He would post, post, post, post, post about Trump. He had some sort of he had a job of sorts as an economist or something. I can't imagine that he was working very hard at his job. He was just posting all day. And that would include things like a new poll coming out of Indiana or just retweeting Trump. Very objective stuff and stuff that was appealing to Trump boomers.  He would also post pretty outrageous alt-right or neo-Nazi content. And if you want me to go find his most...  egregious post. I'm sure I can, but you can just take my word for it. And I remember at one point he said something like, you know, alt-right this, Nazi that, don't pay it any mind, just keep posting, P-O-A-S-T-I-N-G. And I think that was a  a telling remark for the time because it was no enemies on the right big tent. We're all in this for Trump. Don't counter signal any anyone, but also basically be part of the hive mind and promote things that other people are promoting and don't speak about things that other people don't talk about and certainly don't criticize Trump in any way, shape or form. I'm not sure Ricky Vaughn ever said this, but I imagine if you criticize Trump for talking about, you know, the Iran deal, the worst deal in the history of the world, Israel's in peril. If you had, if you had, hold on.  Did I let me just check something real quick? Oh, no, that's right. OK, if if you would criticize Trump fairly, then he would have said that's a brown coated or you're you're demoralizing or you're cringe or whatever. Those words weren't quite in circulation quite yet, but you get my point.  So he was a remarkable figure. He ultimately left due to a legal case, which I believe has sort of been postponed indefinitely. I don't think he's ever seen the inside of a jail cell where he he was promoting tweets that were on. Basically telling blacks in Chicago that voting happens on Wednesday or something, or you can vote by by texting this year like it's new just you don't have to go to the polls just text.  And, you know, look, it's funny. And in some ways, it's an IQ test. Like if you fall for that nonsense, that sort of means you probably shouldn't be voting. Anyway, I'll grant all those things. And there were some other leftists who did similar things like saying, you know, if you're a Trump supporter, remember, Trump is a Wednesday man. He votes on Wednesdays.  And so and those people were not prosecuted for those things. And is it parodies? We could talk about it all day. The fact is, it was illegal just by the letter of the law. And if he had put up flyers in downtown Chicago on telephone poles saying, voting's on wednesday this year or text to vote he would have been arrested and i don't think he would have defenders but due to this weird quality of the internet and due to the weird quality of all of these people where it's all ironic they're always trolling you can't take anything they say seriously  That it's somehow different. And so I remember Tucker Carlson being like Douglas Mackey is a journalist. You know, I mean, it's sort of at this point where you're like, all right, I can't take anyone involved with this seriously. There's some other aspects of this case that I found interesting that are worth talking about. But anyway.  that case was sitting around in the Department of Justice during the Trump administration. And immediately after the election, I think it might have been in January of 2021, the case went forward. So it was clearly...  initiated by Bob Barr. Maybe they held off it. Who knows? Who knows what's going on? We're not in the loop. But anyway, that's been suspended indefinitely. There was also some weird things of what is his name? Richard Swartzman. Richard Swartzman. He's the someone can correct me in here. He's the  Giuliani's assistant. He was involved with Smart Checker, what ultimately became Clearview. And they were interested in, in effect, monetizing and channeling what was then called the alt-right of we want to get information on everyone. And we want this to be a voting force. And maybe they wanted to monetize it as well. That is for them.  Thank you. And so this was all doxxed due to Paul Nalen, who was this goofball Midwesterner who ran for office and got red-pilled to death, basically. He OD'd and went from a Bannon-like populist to a just genocidal Nazi over the course of two weeks. I mean, it was just an insane time. I think a lot of people probably don't know these stories.  And I'm glossing over them, just skating right past them. But there's just fascinating things that happened at that time. So Paul Nalen, again, was running for office and then he just got OD'd on red pills and was posting photos of himself in the White House with rabbis heads on spikes and being like, lol.  Just like it's a bit much. Anyway, he Ricky Vaughn was trying to work for him. And I do remember this whole event. Sorry if I'm dilating all these things and reminiscing, but it's all important. So.  I remember I never liked Paul Nalen. I just, I found him kind of dumb and goofy and I just didn't like him. And the other thing is his tweeting behavior was just outrageous, but he got banned from Twitter. And after that happened, everyone on the alt-right was putting Paul Nalen as their PFP. Just total support from... thousands of accounts that were all right or all right adjacent or whatever, even though he probably didn't deserve much support. But anyway, then there was like a turning on a dime where all of these people and Fuentes was included in this. By the way, this is a previous iteration of Nick Fuentes when he was a lot younger.  And they just went after him, no holds barred, were demeaning him, claiming he's cringe. I agree with them in many ways, although I offer criticism in good faith. I actually wrote a article...  in 2018, saying this is the wrong way to go about it. I made an important distinction at the time, which is between a sort of educational campaign and a campaign that can win. And I think both are of equal value. If anything, I have a tendency towards the educational, as I describe it, campaign, because that's who I am as a person. What I meant by this is that if you want to win, you have to play the game and you have to speak directly to your constituents. You need to offer them things. You need to play the game with figures who are already on the scene. You need to be pragmatic and kind of dumb in a way.  Just fastball right down the middle. Now, and Paul Nalen was not doing that. He was making himself into a terror online. Now, the other way of doing politics, which I find even more interesting, is a kind of educational campaign. So Ron Paul in 2008, to a lesser degree in 2012, but definitely in 2008,  could never have won the presidency and could never have even won a Republican primary.  But he made a name for himself. He excited his base. He brought new people to libertarianism who had never heard of Murray Rothbard before, didn't know Mises from a hole in the ground. And suddenly they were all libertarians. And he got the message out. And it was passionate and authentic.  not effective and not pragmatic, but it was very powerful. And I guess what I was saying is that and I was obviously thinking about me doing this as opposed to Paul Nalen. But it's like Paul Nalen is sort of the worst of all possible worlds in the sense that he's this goofball from the Midwest who should just be playing politics and talking about industries in his hometown. but instead is taking to Twitter and appealing to the schizophrenic extreme right who can't vote for him to begin with. And he wasn't promoting a positive message. He was promoting heads on pikes, in fact. But that so he's he's ruining his chances of actually winning. But then he's not actually educating in any way. I kind of hated this guy, but He doxed all of the machinations behind Ricky Vaughn, I think out of spite, because Ricky Vaughn had been like, hey, man, I'll help you out. You know, I control the Internet. I'm one of the top 10 influencers in the world, according to Time magazine or something like this.  which was sort of true. And then he turned on Paul Nalen and Paul Nalen just doxed his ass. And then the deluge against Paul Nalen got even deeper. And Paul Nalen, I don't think has been heard from, but whatever. I never really liked the guy to begin with. So I was sort of ambivalent about this whole thing.  But Ricky Vaughn is not just some kid. He's connected to people. And there was a 501 C3 run by Marcus Epstein, interestingly, that was raising money for his legal defense and all this kind of stuff. So I guess Ricky Vaughn was a kind of avatar of what was to come, which is that you have this anonymous poster who is presenting himself as in the case of Ricky Vaughn, a kind of hard ass. or as maybe some crazy kid and then when you start digging below the surface you see that it's all part of a coordinated campaign or at least it's part of a hive mind the other thing that i should i would observe about ricky vaughn is that you never know what's serious and this this goes back to this um phrase that i've i've used before which is that are they a nazi pretending to be a trump supporter a republican or are they in fact a republican pretending to be a nazi and in terms of people around douglas mackie it was clearly the latter it was clearly republicans pretending to be nazis And so you have this weird situation where they put on these cloaks of extremism, outrage, baseness, even to the point of like T&D and there's there are no political solutions and siege. And I mean, maybe not quite. you know, literally, but they're they're they're butting up against these sort of extreme, even terroristic like ideas. But it's all on behalf of electing Republicans. I mean, it's this weird contradiction. And the solution to the riddle is that in 2016, the alt right was uncontrolled. It scared Republicans.  Might have been controlled by other entities. We can go into that. But it scared Republicans. And so they decided that we need to harness this force. The best alternative independent movement is the one that we control. And this is a very long-winded setup for the fact that I think all of these...  uh, colorations that I've just put forward really fit a captive dreamer to a tee. So he's pro Trump. He adopts the Ricky Vaughn visage, but this time it's David Koresh. I mean, Ricky Vaughn from the, from, from the movie major league from 1989. That's pretty funny. David Koresh, a pervert who ran a sex cult that ended up being raided by the alcohol, tobacco and firearms and led to the fiery death of children. I don't know. Is that funny?  But if you ever pressed him on it, he would just avoid the issue. We played that interaction that I had with him last week. Actually, if someone wants to put that in the chat, that would be great. I'll just play that again.  It's not just so much that I dunked on him. It's that whenever you try to pin them down on anything, it's all a joke. So like, do you actually believe in, you know, Schmidian fascism? Oh, hey, man, I'm just a Trump supporter.  Or whatever. And it's like, well, are you just a Trump supporter? Oh, no, no, I'm radical. I'm influenced by the conservative revolution in Germany. And in fact, I'm willing to engage in genocide. And, you know, I also hate Israel, like kind of anti-Semitic. Right, bro. But like. Have you noticed that all these people supporting the Palestinians, they're just like brown and cringe, like, yeah, no thanks, buddy. And it's just it just goes round and round and round in circles. And you can't ever interact with them because there's no they're there. This is a very long winded way of introducing the fact, but he got banned and now he's back and we can play a couple of these things right here. So let me just I'll just start sharing my screen. So he got banned last night.  And this is something that he reported. He jumped on an account that also got banned, and this is something that he issued. Is this the free speech app? Wow.  You know, it's kind of interesting. I'll sometimes watch these body language videos and it's just sort of fascinating that his blink rate is zero. Like, just just watch this. Is this the free speech app? Now, granted, that's a very short clip, but. It's it's somewhat interesting. It implies psychopathy in a non-functional limbic system, but anyway.  I can't prove anything. Very large forehead. Let's have a big IQ hidden in that cranium. I think he just needs to shave his head. I mean, at this point, he's just like hanging on to this weird little afro at the crest of his forehead. It just looks terrible. He just needs to get it out, get it off.  It'd look a lot better. Also, I don't want to be too weird here, but do you think there might be significant African ancestry in this man? I made that joke because his parents are evangelicals. So I said, clearly this man is an albino African that was rescued from Uganda by his brave family.  evangelical adoptee parents. It might be true. The redhead is also somewhat suspect, but I can't be sure about that. The other aspect of him, and these are all seemingly contradictory, is the soy lineal quality to this man. Now, granted, no one chooses which generation he's born into, but...  It is just sort of funny, his persona. Like, this does look like you're living in downtown Toronto and walking down Yonge Street. Yeah.  That's just the impression I got. He's extremely soylenial-looking. It's pretty interesting. I don't know. I feel like right-wingers now look like leftists did in the 2010s, and now leftists are looking like Republicans. They've just switched aesthetics in this weird way, and Martin just loves dressing like a hipster. Hipster arm tattoos. Go ahead, Hunkle. Patriot. john doyle affectionately calls him a stomp clap patriot which is like a reference oh my god have you seen john doyle like he's like martin posted a picture of him with all of his like shitty tattoos and he looked exactly like someone you would see at like i don't know a mumper and sons concert or something just he looks just totally yes full Or working at a overpriced hamburger restaurant that outside of which is a giant sign that says eat. Ironically in either neon or bulbs. Yeah. He just has that vibe. Yeah.  The guy you can't get to stop talking about craft beer. You're, like, not interested in the conversation. He likes to go axe throwing. Yes. Yes. He's a funny fellow. But... So, let's go back to what happened. So, I... Regrettably, in fact, jumped on a Twitter space last night and there was someone saying that, oh, he It's he's anti-Indian and there are a lot of Indians working in Twitter and they just got rid of him. And I've heard all of these all of these things. But this is apparently what actually happened. And this is coming from Drew Pavloo, who I've interviewed.  So starting next week to be testing new ways to share and engage with blah, blah, blah, blah. Hey, Nikita, do you guys have any plans on removing doxing of people's homes? Do you think my home and address should have equal visibility as all content online? Because it's been up for days, and despite being reported and found to violate rules, it stays.  So, I mean, I don't know what to say. other than um he was doxing people and elon has clearly stated that doxing is a no-no in fact he's been zealous in being anti-doxing to the point that he banned that kid who was uh posting public information about his plane's whereabouts  And so I don't know what to say. The other narrative I've also heard is that the Gripers mass reported him. Maybe that's true, but maybe he was doxing people. Maybe the people he was doxing are shitty leftist who I who hate me and who I also hate. But then the rules. So I really don't know what to say, really.  But he's back. I mean, that screenshot is very clear, like, what happened. Nikita's, like, one of the head engineers or something at, oh, sorry, at Twitter. So, oh, gosh. What? Do you need to go? Sorry. No, they're, like, doing some weird construction. I don't know if you can hear that. We don't hear it. No, we don't hear it at all. Oh, it's not touching. Okay, it's just very loud. Yeah, the microphone and iPhone is very good, actually.  Oh, wow. Yeah, I mean, it's very clear what happened. He's like the head engineer or something. They just tagged him in a post that, hey, he's doxing people. And that was it. And he was gone. I mean, that is one of the few rules like that's like hard and fast rules on X is just don't dox.  Elon's been pretty clear about that. So it's like the one thing you really can get people banned for. And that's pretty sensible. Like don't post people's home addresses. It's really not hard to not do that. And not only were they doing that, they were like incessantly bragging about it. Like they just thought that nothing would happen. I guess in a sense they are kind of right because they're banned and even last a full day. They're already back.  Right. This is the other thing. I've seen some of these. Tweets involving Captive Dreamer where he's talking about like, oh, Italy is so much better because the age of consent is 12 or something like this. Yeah, 14. 14 rather. Yeah. Just over Juliet's age. But it. See, this is the problem with someone like this, is that you can easily pass that off as a troll. Like, what does it mean? Like, is he being serious or is this just yet more bullshit? I think he's being serious. Right.  He's tweeted about it a lot. There's a screenshot of him. If you search the word 14, he just constantly tweets this about Italy and how we live in a, quote, Christo-fascist country. Because our age of consent is too high. It's funny. Yeah, well... Okay, go ahead, Hunkle.  Yeah, there's, like, Soleon was the other guy who was banned alongside him. He's a full-on, like, pedophile. Yeah, he... Then he just has, like, an anime profile picture of, like, a little girl, which in itself is very suspicious and odd. That and... I think Basil talked about this, but, like, they have, like, group chats dedicated to, like, lolly hentai...  which is like a like child porn, just very disturbing and gross stuff. And they're all like, well, just why did he pick david koresh there's also this funny aspect which is that his father is an evangelical christian in canada and his father hasn't fully rejected him i guess personally i mean i i don't know maybe he has but he has denounced captive dreamers views  And they're not Christlike. They're clearly not Christlike. So is captive. I mean, and this is where, again, you just can't like pen these people down i mean he he's a lot keith woods is a lot like this but but sort of in a less just like radically offensive way but they won't just directly answer questions like do you believe in god or what are you after are you an irish petty nationalist are you a pan european like dialogue can't progress Discourse can't progress unless you take some sort of position so that that can engage in a confrontation with this antithesis. And then you move upward from there. If you're just sort of being all things to all people, what you're doing is recruiting for your cult or your sub stack. And I just don't have any interest in this type of behavior. You can do it.  But I just have no interest. So, again, like, why pick David Koresh? Like, you pick David Koresh as your avatar. You allegedly are involved in some cartoon child pornography. I mean, what is that? Um...  I don't know what to say. Is that real? Is that the real Martin? Or is he in fact using that as a mask to hide a very normal person who just wants to appear edgy and dangerous online? I mean, I think maybe  Both are true in a way. I don't know. But there's just a total lack of seriousness. And so it's just this like, you know, he's so influential. They, you know, you need to be nice to him to be part of his clique. It's just like, yeah, no fucking thanks. I mean, like, I don't respect any of these people.  And they're creepy. That seems to be the one position where you can pin them down because they even do this sort of rear guard action of Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah. Yeah, I think they're pretty consistent enough and just constantly posting about  I don't know, pedophilia, epiphilia, whatever they want to call it. It seems that that's not ironic, and they actually do feel this way. I mean, the David Koresh PFP, I do think that has to do with the fact that that man was, yes, running a sex cult and marrying minors. Yeah. In regards to his dad, some people were pointing out that yesterday was Canadian Thanksgiving and he was just on Twitter all day and all night trying to get his account back in spaces. So I don't think he has a relationship with his family.  Actually, it appears he was not with them on this national holiday. I forgot about that. I lived in Toronto for a little bit. I remember Canadian Thanksgiving is before Halloween or something like that. And they do basically the same thing.  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of doubt he has a relationship with his dad. I think his dad would I think his dad having seen Martin's post would not really want to be around him. His dad seems to be a genuine evangelical. He runs a Christian university. And I can't imagine he likes that his son is posting posts.  like explicit racism. Actually, I do think his dad is probably genuinely really offended by this and doesn't really want to be around him and is embarrassed.  Yeah, this is just interesting. So this is coming from Solionath, however you pronounce that. If Israel was never created, I would have a cute younger sister clinging to me and hugging me and kissing my cheek and running her hands through my head. And all of the family visiting us for Christmas would make remarks about how close we've grown since they last saw us. We'd sneak around and look nervously to make sure that there were no family members nearby before stealing a kiss.  I mean, it's just gross. And then also there's this there's almost like this is the impression I got when I was talking to him, like, what is so funny about this? That that whole thing about if they're like, if there were no Jews around, I wouldn't be bald. This is sort of the criticism of anti-Semites, which hits the mark, actually, if we're honest, often where you're like, I don't have a job because of Jews.  You know, the women are women these days hate men because of Israel. Like, you know, it is you do actually hear that, to be fair, but he's making the form of that joke. But then embedded within it seems to be some weird incest fantasy. I mean, what is wrong with these people? If it weren't for Jews, I'd get to fuck my sister in peace. i mean what what on the jews actually want you to do that no i i that's kind of closer to the mark anyway um yeah this is we'll just play this again we were actually having an interesting conversation i i do you understand how to converse with people no i do not just leave it then why don't you hold on lucen can i ask you a question why do you think that's funny  Why are you interjecting while they're cooking, Box? Let them answer back and forth. What's so funny, Captain? Can you tell me what's funny about that? Trying to bridge a gap, you know?  I'm trying, I'm trying to basically create a dialogue. You're so creepy. You're like pulling out this. This is the long house. The long house is coming in. Lucent K. Oh, the long house. Are you, you're like really Twitter brand? Like, what do you think outside of like memes and catchphrases? The long house. We get it. The long house. Correct. All right. But I'm the one speaking. Am I, am I the long house? Captain dreamer.  Go ahead, Richard. Tell me what you're trying to say here. All right. So is this true? You were tweeting about Radfim Hitler a lot. What points were you making? Why are we talking about Radfim Hitler? because we're talking about okay this is very because this is a discussion like a what this is like when a five-year-old just keeps on read asking questions and refuses because this is a this is a discussion forum that takes place using the english language yes and we discuss  current events, and other cultural matters of interest. The current topic is a reported tragedy that occurred just today where apparently... You're boring me, Richard. I'm going to leave this. You're boring me. You're a very boring person. Sorry.  He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him. He's a very, he's got an edge that's not good. He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Who is Trump talking about? I presume not. I don't know. No, I wish. I can't get over how gay his voice is the whole time. He's like, is this the Longhouse? Is this the Longhouse? just so like weird and sinister and gay yeah it is it is these funny thing i remember retweeting this i mean maybe this is a bit mean but there was someone that did like millennial starter pack and it had like it had like a burger with like a little twisted toothpick like in the top which indicates that this cost twenty dollars as opposed to five dollars and um there was like vinyl records of yeah mumford and sons or something and there was there was captive dreamer like standing there with his hipster tattoos a very funny he is a very funny person to be criticizing the long house i know and also he apparently is married to a woman who has a job which raises even more questions of whether he is a house husband he is he's not employed interesting and his wife is quite attractive it's it's interesting how he's yes um it's a very attractive woman i don't know how he's pulled that off i guess he really is just a psychopath well maybe earlier he was just like a hipster like in 2018 when they got married he was just some like hipster guy living in toronto sorry that's you don't say toronto  And he was just cool. They met over matchas and one thing led to another and he was going to get a job and then he just became a shit lord. Not quite matcha. I think more like kombucha if it's 2016. Matcha is more now. Yeah. family money can carry a lot of weight yeah I was gonna that's kind of my theory it seems that his family's pretty successful and I think that's probably how he pulled this off but now he's probably been cut off by them so it seems he's relying on her and his Twitter payouts which is why I guess he just kept desperately making new accounts and yeah like he's just completely panicked by losing it losing his uh his access it seems yeah Um, there's some other things that are going on here, and let me I'm going to share the screen again. Okay. So. Here are just a couple of things. This is Curtis. This is just a long post here.  okay, not going to contribute, not going to be contributing more to this platform. I'll use it to post links, promos, et cetera. This platform could easily have been turned into the collective brain of the next century. That's what managing it for power would have meant. Managing it for money and you get AI slot porn bots and pictures of Eve jobs. Fair enough. But first off,  underestimates the degree to which the purchase of Twitter was political. And it might've just been entirely political. And it was a successful, I didn't think it was going to be successful at first in 2023, but successful recreation of the atmosphere in 2015 and 2016 with crazy pro-Trump post posts.  Many of which were a I slop. So I think Curtis is not really reflecting on how powerful the purchase of Twitter was. Would Trump have been elected without Elon's purchase of Twitter? He might have been, but I'm I don't know. Actually, it was a significant factor. And when he also says, like, the collective brain, what he means by that is like a sovereign house cocktail party where everyone is collectively around him. But this seems to have bothered him in a way that you might not expect, which also, like, this is what sparked this tweet, this Captive Dreamer thing.  So Captive Dreamer was a slot merchant. I mean, let's be honest, Curtis, but he was your slot merchant, I guess. This is JF mentioned this. I thought this was interesting. What the fuck is happening in the teal sphere? Why are the real old schoolers not getting banned, but the teal butt boys are?  It's interesting. Yarvin was in Elon's DMs just a few months ago. Well, he also leaked, in all likelihood, leaked to the New York Times that he was meeting with Elon, and Elon didn't like that. So that's probably one reason he's no longer there. Normification of the Republican Cheerleader Network by Musk. I have no idea what's going on. Can someone explain? It is interesting. Like... yarvin is leaving twitter he's taking his ball and going home captive dreamers back i i don't know it's it's interesting is he he's saying that the old school people aren't getting banned but the like captive dreamer and stuff are yeah but but also yarvin seems to be leaving Well, I mean, I think that, I don't know about Yarvin leaving, but I mean, I think that makes perfect sense. Yarvin is much more closer to actual power than these people are. They're kind of LARPing and they're kind of going off, oh, JD Vance follows me. But like, how close are they actually to this admin? Yarvin is a close personal friend of Peter Thiel and Peter Thiel is his patron. And Peter Thiel is good friends with Elon. These people obviously are much closer to real power than... martin and solianath i don't think that that's weird that makes perfect sense these people are kind of larping and hoping that and thinking they have more connections i think than they do and they're kind of exaggerating it a bit but he's just kind of followed by jd but i don't think he's actually in these people's ears and in contact with them yeah it is fascinating this romance  So millennial. So 2010. Yeah. Captured Dreamer doesn't hit the gem very often, doesn't it look like? No, he does look significantly less bad here, though. You can tell he's been drinking a lot since. His face really blew up. He's got the alcohol bloat. yeah when was this like 2000 like five seven years ago 2010s maybe yeah yeah sometime during that you get the filter on this photo looks very 2010s i'd say like 2016 or so yeah just by the look of it interesting um  does anyone else have anything on this? I mean, this is the, I guess we could go back. I mean, the reason I think I talked with captive dreamer is that he was promoting the idea that, um, you had inspired the school shooting. Yes. And he knew that was not true, but I mean, Martin's whole point is to spread, um, disinformation i mean that's very intentional like they i don't they don't really uh they don't really care i mean they they like i said they're openly dox people um as well and they don't have a problem with that i mean martin after the charlie kirk thing declared it's okay to dox gripers now Oh, he actually was promoting the idea that Gripers killed Charlie Kirk, which was sort of in the air a month ago or so. It's interesting. I don't even know if he was promoting that. Maybe it's just that they weren't, like, falling in line enough after the shooting. Yeah. Because Nick, although he was saying, like, this is terrible and...  you know, this is wrong and that this means they're going to come after us as well. He still wasn't falling in line. And, you know, as you're saying, they're so clicky and you have to like completely agree with them. So he declared that... that he's going to start doxing Groypers and to send him information on Groypers actually so he can post it and like contact their employers and stuff. So Martin just does not even care about like pretending to not do these things. He's just quite open with it. You know, on a deeper topic and this came up the other night in the space, which I almost I almost feel like I'm going to stop joining these spaces, to be honest, because. you like there's like five minutes of good discussion and then it's just people butting in and interrupting and going on non sequiturs and tangents and i just find this situation our our community to be just so much more productive just infinitely more productive But anyway, one of the few gems in that space that I was just hopping on when I was actually cleaning up and making dinner was the notion of anonymity itself. And I remember there was this... Clip of Nikki Haley back in the summer of 2024, maybe earlier when she was actually running in the Republican primaries, maybe it's 2023. And she was like, you know, whenever you tweet something, you should just think, what would my pastor think about that?  And it's kind of silly and Southern and sweet and whatever. And people would make fun of her. She's awful. I ultimately agree with her, not necessarily about what would my pastor think about this tweet. Captive Dreamer should contemplate what his father pastor should think about that.  But my father disowned me over this tweet. Right. I really I get the whole idea of anonymity. Obviously, you can lose your job. And I also get the sort of fun idea of anonymity. And I and I definitely felt like this back in the day when I was much more in favor of the online right.  of just the sort of outlandish fun quality to posting, just posting bizarre, silly memes. You know, I remember this one always just weirdly comes to mind because it's almost like self-deprecating about the far right. But it shows this like obese American walrus. He's like some sort of Wojak in a like obese obesity wheelchair. And then there's, like, a Jew holding a fishing rod, and the line has, like, a hamburger, you know? And so he's, like, attracted to the hamburger. And then, like, behind the Jew, there's, like, a Mason guy holding up, like, the Star of David in front of the Jew. And then, like, behind the guy who's in the, like, you know, Mason group, there's, like, an actual alien, like, holding up a... A lizard person. Yeah, like...  Yeah, Lizard. I mean, it's funny and it's also sort of self-deprecating because that is sort of how the right wing thinks. There's like, well, let me tell you about who's behind the Masons. And so I for whatever reason, this always comes to mind. I remember seeing that and just cracking up, being just like, this is so hilarious. So I get the whole spirit of the anonymous far right and it's fun to shitpost and so on. But  I don't know. My feelings changed a lot through the QAnon experience. My feelings changed a lot through the Ricky Vaughn experience. My feelings changed a lot through the Captive Dreamer experience. And I'm just using him as a placeholder for something larger than himself. And I just...  I don't know what to say. I think if you want to engage in politics, you should just simply use your name because you do have to take responsibility. And if you're going to be fired, then don't play the game. And I'm sorry, but that's what it is. It's almost like wanting to go out on the football field, but then complaining when someone tackles you. You're playing football.  That's what it is. And the ability now of foreign actors to use either outright bots and AI-generated content to pay $7,000 for a pro-Israel tweet, that's been going around, to fund in either in-kind donations or just outright cash people who are pro-Russia, pro-Israel, the Qatari situation, the this, the that, the what.  I'm just sort of at the point of like, this is so much worse. If Walter Cronkite ever got caught accepting a bag of bills from the Kremlin, we would never hear the end of that story. That would be like the snake in the Garden of Eden, the time when the American media establishment was revealed to be utterly and thoroughly corrupt. The fact is that kind of situation in big and small ways happens 100 times a day on the Internet at this point. And the Internet has superseded television in terms of impact and importance.  And so I just, I don't know. I don't want to hear from these people like how the mainstream media lies to them or something when social media is a bunch of people hiding behind masks lying to you constantly. There's much more. Yeah, go on. Sorry, go ahead. There's just much more lies you're seeing in alternative media than you are seeing in the mainstream. It's just kind of, I mean, they're at least held to some sort of standard, some sort of regulation. I understand, yes, the mainstream media does lie, but the idea that like, oh, I'm going to get all the facts on YouTube and Twitter at this point is just so insanely diluted. Yeah.  The mainstream media lies by omission as well. And the mainstream media lies by like where they shine their flashlight, basically. So the mainstream media lies, quote unquote, by not, for an example, talking about race differences in intelligence or something. They will never cover that where they I don't know. The New York Times actually has. So in some ways, anyway. you get my point they won't talk about this and they'll ignore it so they're lying by omission which is a different kind of lying it's not outright lying it's simply pointing the flashlight in different direction the mainstream media will lie by uh punching up and promoting you know weapons of mass destruction in iraq well  When they did that, they were in The New York Times did that. They were going along with the government. And it's not like it was totally implausible or or whatever that Saddam was developing a nuclear weapon. Like if you sort of looked at it in a little way and use some speculation and whatever, you could come to that conclusion.  And obviously you're motivated to come to that conclusion. I get it. But it's very different than just telling you a falsehood. And so, yeah, of course, the mainstream media is problematic because it's it's connected to the establishment and it's and other things, et cetera, et cetera. I don't disagree with any of those critiques, but I think those critiques are meaningless when you compare it to the complete like foreign funded mendacious shit show that is social media.  So anyway, my my point that the conclusion I came to last night is that Nikki Haley is right. Your pastor is watching. And also you should you I don't know how this can be done. And I think there should be a digital bill of rights, so to speak. But a digital bill of rights includes duties and not just rights.  So you have a right to a social media account. You can't just be banned from the Internet. Now, if you are engaging in just outright harassment, you could get suspended, but you'll get it back. Much like going to jail. If you harass your ex-girlfriend or whatever, they could send you to jail, but you'll also return at some point. It's not for life. So you have a way of acting in a reasonable fashion and getting your account back.  You have recourse. But also, maybe we could say you have to have one account. Or if you have an alt account, it has to be connected to your person. If you want to take part in this game, if you want to jump on the football field, you're going to get tackled. You're going to have to take responsibility for what you say. and but you can't be banned without reason um if you use your twitter account to like conduct drug deals or whatever maybe you won't have a twitter account for for five years or ten years but you will eventually have one and the punishment fits the crime and i i just think that this is the only way to go  And I would 100% support that. And I know a lot of people would hate on me because they seem to believe that like It's like this myth of 2016 that, you know, Trump only won due to these like four channers who were anonymous, just spamming boomers with proton content, red pilling everyone. I sort of get this vibe and I believed in that myself at one point. But even if there's some truth to that, that is outweighed by the mendacious shithole that social media has become.  And, you know, like, I don't know what to say in the dangers of Sora and AI generated video. I mean, there's a ton of slop.  first off, and that should be verified as such. But yeah, there is this possibility that everyone's talked about of, you know, you have a video of Vladimir Putin declaring war on Poland and, you know, World War III has begun, the missiles are flying. And it's all fake, but it looks real. And  It's not just boomers who are getting fooled. No reasonable people cannot tell the difference between that video and an actual footage. And that's just a big problem. And there needs to be a fucking return address stamp on a video like that so it can be taken down or at the very least it can be examined critically before all hell breaks loose. To piggyback on your point, Twitter would be a much better place if you had to register, say, with your ID, like your driver's license or some state ID. And then you can essentially geofence the things you want to interact with. So it's like you're not getting shit from India or Israel or whatever. It's like I want to see things produced in North America, in Europe. That is excellent. hadn't even thought of that i haven't even thought about that yeah like we could we the world could actually just silo indians yes they would only be interacting with one another yeah yeah do you want to see slop coming from the asian subcontinent like no i don't no thank you no thank you sar And also, there are ways where you can't be certain, but with a reasonable amount of certainty, you can think that this is an AI-generated text. And you could just say, I don't want to... If the algorithm is 60% certain that this is an AI-generated text, I don't even want to see it. Just get it off my timeline.  I want to see someone write a thought.  But I don't know if we'll ever get there. I don't know if Elon will do this because Elon, I mean, Yarvin is getting at something correct when he says that Elon just wants to make money through slop content and the proliferation of pornography, the proliferation of AI slop. I mean, I don't know what to say. Is he fighting it and he's just overwhelmed by it or is he actually promoting it? I can't quite tell.  I think he's definitely promoting it. Elon clearly just wants to make money. You know, he bought this for quite a big chunk of change, and originally it was for, you know, to win this election. But, you know, obviously that part's over, and now Elon just wants to maximize profit from this. I mean, he is, you know, a tech guy who starts companies and buys them. Like, that's his motivation here. And allowing porn and AI slop to proliferate, it just gets more money for him.  So I don't think he's ever going to do anything about that. That's clearly the point. He just doesn't really care about Twitter anymore. It's just now he just wants to profit off it. I don't know if this is a bit of a pivot, but I'm wondering if this can kind of turn into a social credit system and maybe an Apollonian sense of a social credit system that with proof of blockchain and proof of work that You could kind of build a societal structure that could funnel out the people that are creating bullshit and less productive. Just jumping in with thought. Yeah, I mean, there's like, you know, you can do like the blockchain of like, like KYC blockchain type stuff where if you aren't, if you aren't a verified individual, like you just don't gain access to this, this sphere, this space, or you can't log on or whatever it is. I mean, that could be done in theory.  I think also they already do it with finances. There's no reason you couldn't do it with a credential. I'm kind of thinking of the social credit system in China, but more for the European, for the creating race, kind of showing the positive qualities. It would simply select out the people all the way from not opening the door for some old lady to financial to creative aspects the other thing is elon in his reddit brain has said things like you know truth seeking is about you know the free marketplace of ideas or something and and this has been a libertarian assumption since oliver wendell holmes very unfortunate um rejoinder his his minority opinion in a free speech case so i'm actually not in favor of free speech i don't know if i've told anyone this Oliver Wendell Holmes was wrong about free speech, but he was right on some very other important questions. The marketplace of ideas. So Oliver Wendell Holmes basically said, like, who's to say? Bolshevik anarchists, maybe they're right. America's different. Let's try it out. It's a big chemistry lab, and let's just put things in test tubes and see if they explode. I don't like that. I don't like that from a sort of...  conservative perspective, but I also don't think that's truth-seeking. Maybe a free market of ideas is a  necessary but insufficient grounding for truth-seeking. But just free markets of ideas are not truth-seeking. And you're equating economics with truth, which are very different things. Like, labubus are very popular. Cheetos, also, just immensely popular. Cheetos has won.  in the marketplace of junk food. Congratulations. Is Cheetos the truth? No. Cheetos might very well have won because it is stupid and people are stupid and people want to eat crap, including myself. But I would never say that Cheetos are the truth. You're just you're just you're equating two very, very, very different things. And if there could be like a social credit score, all of conservatives hate this stuff, but maybe that's whenever they hate something, maybe we should start looking into it like a social credit score of. And this could be measured to some degree. Obviously, there can be differing opinions.  You know, on some level where, you know, do we know this truth about Shakespeare? Do we really know the truth about quantum physics or is it actually very mysterious? That's a fair point. But you could basically say, are you citing? Are you citing sources?  If you're engaging in a text, are you directly quoting from the text and interpretation? And are you using logic correctly? And taking parsimoniously taking leaps. You know, I admitted last Sunday, I thought that was a great session. And I admit like I'm when I.  My analysis of Romeo and Juliet, I think, is right in its sound. But I also admit I am kind of taking a bit of a leap in promoting that theory that Romeo represents Judaism in the Old Testament and Juliet represents Judaism.  Christianity, Rome and other things like it's a bit of a leap, but it's justified. And I'm not engaging in any sort of logical, fallacious thinking while reaching that conclusion. You can certainly disagree with me. But I am contributing to discourse like, you know, is there a way that that could be measured with AI? The amount of sources, not necessarily the amount of sources getting cited by other sources, which they sometimes use in academia, like this paper gets cited 10,000 times because that could just that could just show group think or it can get cited because it's wrong and people are just reacting to it.  But are you declaring your sources? Are you taking logical steps forward and contributing to discourse? Like there could be almost a good faith estimate done via AI. imperfect no doubt but it could be measured and could you rate people based on that as opposed to rate rating people based on fucking clicks that can be manipulated through bots that can also just be manipulated through the human insatiable human desire for slop  Just a thought. Well, anyone else want to jump in on this? Hey, Richard. Can you hear me? Yeah. I've actually got something that I've been working on for a while. You just made me think about it. It's basically this thing that it takes a program called Whisper. It's an AI based off of OpenAI. And it takes the spaces, the audio directly from the spaces, like when I'm arguing and deconstructing Christianity from people. And it's directly feeding into an AI that basically has the prompt of tell me what they're talking about. And if they say anything that's untrue, tell me and cite the source that's telling them that what they're saying is untrue. So what happens is I get people from the Bible or talk about the Bible, and they'll say, oh, what about John 844? That shows that Jesus is anti-Semitic. Can't you see that? And in real time with like a 15-second delay, it says to me, John 844, often considered anti-Semitic. It's not because blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what I mean? So it's in real time fact checking. You're using this right now, or is this hypothetical? Yeah, no, I've been using this for about like six months off and on. It basically uses like a button. It's very ghetto, but it only works for like what I use on the spaces. Um, but I, I know I've been working with a couple of people and a couple of programmers that are in our sphere trying to turn it into like an app, you know what I mean? It's basically like, uh, uh, like, uh, like an umpire for arguments is what I would call it. Right. Yeah. Um, and when you, so when you say things like, uh, you know, kind of like a social credit score, I think it's going to be something more along the lines of that. Right. Where it's like, um,  You just give it the parameters. These are the values or the truth, basically. You just say the reason that we're trying to do this thing is to get to whatever the truth is, and then you have the AI built off of that. That's kind of its internal logic, and then everything else kind of falls in place from that. But that's the way I would envision kind of how this sort of thing you're talking about moves forward. This is sort of like AI assistant. Yeah. Like, again, in baseball, the umpire calls balls and strikes. And he does other things, of course. So that's the fundamental thing. And interestingly, in the minor leagues, they've had this for like five years, and they're going to have it in the major leagues now. You can challenge an umpire's call by...  hitting your head. And there actually is an AI strike zone. And if the ball so it looks at the batter, I presume this is what it does. It looks at the batter and it measures the knees to the letters to the nipples, basically, and the plate. That is the strike zone. It's a rectangle. And if the ball nips, even just touches it, even if most of the ball is outside of the strike zone, but it nips it, that's a strike.  And so they're bringing this into Major League Baseball. So they're using AI to basically improve the game. It would be sort of – I don't know. This is neither here nor there. But I don't know. I think baseball sort of – one of the fun aspects of it is the big fat –  you know, ump behind the plate, you know, you know, you don't want to totally get rid of that. That can't be replaced. I got one that's really terrifying. I had to listen to an argument between me and, um, well, my ex-girlfriend and, uh, tell me who was right or wrong. And that was very interesting, but you could literally just have something like sit there and listen to arguments. Right. And tell you like, oh, they lied there, or hey, they said something that's untrue there, or they overstretched this premise and things like that, right? Because we know intrinsically, if we had an unlimited amount of time, if we could just like pause time and go through and research together, we could analyze every single claim that somebody makes. And that's kind of what this thing is doing.  Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm endorsing this. Like, I don't think it's perfect, but I think it could actually be very helpful. Like if if you if you are put it could conceivably I could imagine a I could pick out a logical fallacy. and i also imagine that just simply a factual claim that someone makes that's wrong it could at least highlight that and you know explain yourself here i mean yeah it's it could obviously pick out a misquotation part of what it does is um there's an ai by google called notebook llm and i have a paid subscription to it and what i've done is i've taken a pdf of every book i've ever read  and put it in this thing. And basically it self-references what you put in it, right? So it's one of those types of AIs. And what it does is I can legitimately just like think of a page. Like I could be like, oh, I can't remember what book this was from. The page was talking about like the history of Troy and how they dug this up. And the archeologist, I can't remember his name. It was like a German name and it will literally recall the exact page number and paragraph I'm talking about.  So I have it plugged into that too, right? So you could literally just like, you could actually like feed it the exact information that you're basing it off of to kind of like fact check itself. And not only, and like, it's not reliant on the AI's conclusion, right? It's like, I have the footnote I could double click on and go to the exact page number that it's like citing from, right? Is that person Schliemann, the archeologist who uncovered Troy?  I think so. That was just like an example I used it for. Yeah, I know. I was thinking. That's basically what I've been using it for is I've been using it to like catalog information that I already know and like to instantly recall it. So like while I'm, you know, like I said, while I'm doing these spaces, I can literally, I can say stuff like a good example is oftentimes we get guys who believe in Khazar theory. And I have like a whole article that I've written on like why Khazar theory is wrong and debunking and all this other stuff. So I have it, the prompt says, If somebody mentions the word Khazar, instantly bring up my article on Khazar theory to like – and how that works, right? So you could literally just have this thing built out and train it to do exactly what we're talking about, which is ultimately to have like a mediator on what's true while being like socially responsible European-minded people and not just like addicted to the AI slot. You know what I mean? Like making the AI work for us. yeah uh totally ai can work for us it within boundaries i mean it there's there's no doubt about it i'm not against this technology um i have criticisms of the technology but it it can be amazing if used like an umpire like way yeah  It was funny. I was actually I was looking at chat GPT the other night after I did my discussion of Romeo and Juliet. And I was basically asking, like, has anyone promoted the idea that romeo and juliet involves religious tensions and they're like oh no no one's ever said this they're like uh uh to some you know you it could be performed like that it could be like protestants and catholics or or whatever but um no one's ever suggested that like has anyone suggested that romeo represents judaism and they're like no one's ever written this before So it's interesting, but AI can be very useful in that sense, in the sense that it's effectively Google. There's an index of the internet and it could quickly search through it all and look for it. What I'm doing is totally original. Why I can't be replaced by AI. Good stuff. I wanted to talk a little bit, not too in depth about  Peter Thiel and the Antichrist, actually. There's some interesting articles that are out about that. First, I just wanted to talk about Tucker here a little bit. And I know this is low-hanging fruit, but I feel like it's worth picking.  So this is something that he released this past weekend. And here he is in his cabin in Maine. the next few years the nights the next few years the united states the next few years the united states the next few years the united states two things to keep in mind united states is moving not inexorably but still moving toward civil war  Number one. And number two, civil wars are the very worst kind of wars, worse than any kind of war fought against a foreign adversary. So to number one, why is America moving towards civil war? For the same reason all countries that wind up in civil war get there, because the differences between their population, between people within their borders,  becomes too great to bear. People decide, I have nothing in common with people who live near me, and I don't want to live near them anymore. In other words, diversity, difference, is actually intolerable to most people. Not necessarily racial diversity, though sometimes that too, but diversity of all kinds. It is not our strength. In fact, it is without question our weakness, and it has always been. If you have nothing in common with your wife, do you have a stronger marriage? No, of course your marriage falls apart, and the same is true for countries. And the truth about the United States is that on every level, beginning with a demographic level, the American population has less in common with itself, with one another, than ever before. When I was born, which wasn't that long ago, it was the modern era. It was air travel and air conditioning, electricity.  When I was born, the United States was about 90% white Christian. It's now less than 40% white Christian. Notice that he's this white Christian now. So that seems to be a little like escape latch that he wants to jump out of.  I have a lot to say on this, but I'll just let him finish his statement. I think that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's a massive change, an unprecedented change, really, in a very short period of time. And of course, it's not accidental or organic. That was the result of policies put in place to achieve that result, and they did. There are people who didn't want a majority white Christian country. Okay.  They got what they wanted. Ted Kennedy didn't want a white Christian. I'm not sure about that, but I do agree that policies affected this. What do they have? They have a country with no majority demographically at all. There is no American majority, which is to say 51% of people have something very basic in common.  And so what you have is an inherently fractured country. Languages, religions, ethnicities, backgrounds, beliefs, too innumerable to catalog. And so a country like that, unless unified by something, will split apart, particularly when that country is the size of a continent and is held together by a pretty fragile web of infrastructure, air routes and highways. Okay. Okay.  There's a lot there. We're headed towards civil war. It sounds like what he's describing is not civil war, but wars of succession. There used to be a country called Czechoslovakia that was part of the Eastern Bloc. And I don't even know what the divisions are between  Czechs and Slovaks. Someone could enlighten me. But Czechoslovakia split apart, and it was called the Velvet Divorce in the sense that there was actually no bloodshed, and everything's fine. Now, I also agree that if...  I don't even know what state would do this according to Tucker's own terms. But if like the whites of Alabama avoiding the black belt wanted to split into their own country and they did that tomorrow morning, I could imagine there could be bloodshed even if they were simply trying to secede. that that would just piss off the government enough that they would not let it happen uh we're returning to the 1860s here and and and so on uh but that's what he's describing civil war is something very different civil war is going to be a battle for the capital of who gets to define what the united states is  Now, are we in a civil war type situation? Are we creeping towards that, if not quite inexorably, but creeping still towards that? I think that's possible. And I wouldn't have said that five years ago or so, but... Do you think that there is enough division within the elite right now that Donald Trump wants to send...  troops into Portland and Chicago, etc. And he wants to crack down on what's going on in those states. And there are other elite forces, the liberal forces, who don't want to do that and want to prevent anything like that from ever happening. And so we're going to have a civil war where it's sort of Gavin Newsom leading the left wing charge with some elite people, maybe Wall Street's on his side and Trump holed up in the White House and still wanting to bomb civilians. It's like just literally that Eric Garland movie, Civil War. Possibly. I think it's reasonable to speculate on that.  I do think that we're headed for interesting times and maybe bad times as well. But it's also worth pointing out with Tucker Carlson. This is something that has bothered me for quite some time about him. But...  Do you notice the white Christian thing? And I pointed that out. So what is America right now? Is it 55 to 60 percent white?  I think it's 60-something. 60-something. It was 65 not too long ago. I think it's more than 55%. There's this 2050 number that someone said it's 54% non-Hispanic. Now, keep something in mind. The census changed a few years ago.  I guess in 2020, where they're counting more mixed-race people. So previously, mixed-race people were sort of undercounted, or they had to go on one side or the other in the census. Now they're more accurately counting mixed-race people, which is fair enough, probably is more accurate. And so this skews things. The white Christian thing, I mean, don't you think he's just describing polarization more than anything, but he's using these terms? Now, maybe polarization could lead to a war of secession or breakup like this, but it's just like the white, the 40%, the white Christians, the kind of like people who vote Republican. Yeah.  I don't know. Maybe that's how it will break up left and right. But. It's like. The great replacement theory. That was promoted by Camus. is about race certainly but it's more than that and he would describe like the las vegasification of france and things like this where there wouldn't be any longer a authentic uniquely french  seaside town, but there's basically a resort for tourists and that Frenchness is being erased. So there was a kind of traditionalist, even romantic quality to the great erasure. But there was just an outright racial quality to it in the hands of Tucker Carlson. It becomes the Democrats want to  bring in Democrat voting Hispanics in order to erase conservatives or something like this. It's just he takes these things and he removes whatever like real powerful quality there is. And he turns it into this plausibly deniable race baiting game that he plays. And then it becomes this kind of partisan game.  Where, you know, in 1965, people were secretly scheming to bring in Democrat voters. Even though. Say what you will about the Hart Seller Act, but really up into the 1980s, due to the family reunification paradigm, immigration was largely European. When 1965 came around and it's like, well, you know, this is the complement to the Civil Rights Act. We're not going to discriminate. It's not like they open the floodgates and all of these Hispanics came rushing in. Interestingly, the Immigration Restriction Acts in the 1920s didn't even address Mexico.  or South America, because it wasn't at that time considered a pressing issue. It instead addressed Southern Europeans, Italians and Eastern Europeans and was basically about maintaining America as a kind of Northern Euro Protestant country, by the way.  Um, but basically things started to shift over time after the 65 act. So this sort of conspiracy theory that I've heard about the 1965 act just doesn't hold water. Like the, the idea that they would imagine that 20 years later, Democrat voting Hispanics would come in or something. I just, I'm not sure I buy that. And secondly, um,  I don't know what's going to happen after all of these ice crackdowns or whatever. Are the Hispanics going to flip on Trump or whatever? But we've Hispanics have not been like blacks in their voting patterns. They've all they've been 60 40 to a very large extent. And there are these remarkable outcomes of Hispanics in Florida and Texas voting Republican.  And Texas has not gone blue, even though whites are a distinct minority. They're a minority in Texas. So I don't even know what to say. Intermarriage rates between Hispanics and whites are high. It's the most common interracial marriage, if you want to call Hispanics a race. And it's actually very... uh consistent i guess is the right word like the same amount of white men who marry hispanic women that pairing is is equally distributed to um his uh hispanic men marrying white women whichever i said you get the point it's not like whites and asians or anything like that it's very equal  And I don't buy the idea that Hispanics are not natural Republicans. This is another thing that Ann Coulter would always say. She's like, blacks are natural Republicans. Hispanics, no.  You know, we need to shut down the border to keep out the Democrats. Blacks will never be Republicans. I'm sorry, not in the foreseeable future, not in my lifetime. Maybe black men are going to like lean a little bit more towards Trump. It's always going to be 90 and 80 percent. It's going to be just effectively Democratic to the extent that blacks voted all. They're going to vote for Democrats. Hispanics are actually not like that because the Hispanic category is.  ambiguous and kind of free floating. And Florida and Texas are clear examples of red states that have become redder in the case of Florida as the demographic change has taken place. So I don't buy any of this, basically. The other thing, and this is where I'll get personal on Tucker, but let's just play a little bit of Tucker's previous commentary here. These are just some things I found. This is... I mean, this is part of the sad thing of Happy Canada as far as I'm concerned, and just to restate...  These issues that I think are important. I mean, I think that, you know, the sovereignty of the American military, etc. I mean, these are not just crank issues. But unfortunately, Pat Buchanan raises them in a way that I think is discredited. And when attacked, he can always fall back on the line. well, the tiny cabal that controls American politics doesn't like me because I speak truth to power. This is actually, incidentally, almost verbatim what he said the other day, that I offend the plutocracy, that I'm a wanted man by the inside the beltway people, and in every sense cast himself as a victim who is sort of a Karen Silkwood of politics, someone who's so truthful that he's being hunted down by the conspiracy that runs Washington.  it's all a bit much. Maybe Pat Buchanan just says things that are kind of kooky, and that's why he's being criticized. It's perfectly valid to question America's relationship with Israel. Israel has a lobby. It's perfectly fair, as far as I'm concerned, to beat up on Israel's lobby. But I don't think that's the reason that Buchanan is being labeled an anti-Semite. It's this kind of, as I've said, this relentless bringing up topics related to Judaism. I mean, famously, Pat always beats up on Goldman Sachs, but never Morgan Stanley. I mean, it's really hard to There is no point at which Pat Buchanan has held a press conference and said, you know, I really don't like the Jews. I think they're a sinister force in America. But I think, and it took me years to come to this position. I mean, I'm not throwing the term anti-Semite around. But you reach a point when you say, well, gee, you know, here's a guy who has gone out of his way to defend Kim Jong-un and other accused... Nazi war criminals who's constantly attacked Israel, who's attacked American Jews for supporting Israel unduly, who's implied that American Jews push America into wars in which non-Jews die. There really is, and again I'm not hysterical on this subject, but I do believe that there is a pattern  with Pat Buchanan of needling the Jews. Is that anti-Semitic? Yeah. I mean, after a while you conclude it is, in some sense, anti-Semitic. I mean, Pat Buchanan obviously has a lot of personal and affectionate relationships with people who are Jewish. So on a personal level, perhaps he's not, but on a different  maybe thematic level, I think he probably is. I think that people should be allowed to have differing views on immigration. I think people should be allowed to point out the fact that there is an Israeli lobby, and yes, it's powerful, and debate the merits of that, I guess. I don't think there's, strictly speaking, anything wrong with that. But again, I think... Pat Buchanan is part of the reason it's so hard to have that conversation, because he discredits it by his presence, because he gives people who watch him carefully the sense that he has another agenda that has to do with personal dislike and that he believes in conspiracies and that he believes that the Jews are this sinister, secretly organized force trying to affect American politics. And those aren't discussions I think normal people, sober people, should be having, because I think they're ludicrous. yeah um that was where tucker carlson was you see also underneath there the weekly standard so i presume that was from 20 years ago or maybe even a little bit longer that's when tucker was working at the bastion of neoconservative thought the weekly standard edited by um bill crystal and company and um there's just a lot there first off there was a renewed attack on pat during that period david from wrote a piece called unpatriotic conservatives making the exact same arguments that tucker just made i would imagine tucker read that and is repeating them verbatim  or paraphrasing them, I should say. And this was all over the fact that Pat Buchanan didn't support the Iraq War and actually was vehemently against it and to some degree called out Israel. But at the very least would say things like, you know, we're fighting and The Middle East and the people who are going to die have last names like Smith and Schliemann and Martinez. He even threw in the Hispanics there. They're going to die, too, for the war against the Jews or the war on behalf of the Jews. So, yeah, Pat was, you know, being hot and provocative, but he was obviously getting at something very important. And Tucker was directly in opposition to people like Pat Buchanan at that time. Now, Tucker, fast forward 20 years, and Tucker at Charlie Kirk's funeral says, you know, the Pharisees, you know, we've got this guy. He's speaking the truth. He's talking about our corruption. Maybe we should just kill him. That's where Tucker is. he's offering a sort of plausibly deniable conspiracy theory that the Jews or the Pharisees to the extent that they exist killed Charlie. And he does it in this hysterical, again, sort of,  murky way that you can't just pin him down and say, Is this what you really mean? But he does it nevertheless. So all of these criticisms fit to a tee of Tucker Carlson Tucker Carlson. I just listened to a little bit of this as I was falling asleep last night and I did fall asleep, so I wasn't really paying attention to it. But he is interviewing Alex Jones and he was like, How is it that you're so right?  just embracing all of this bullshit. To the point that it's like, yeah, Tucker, I think you might be discrediting opposition towards a war against Iran or you're discrediting genuine patriotic immigration reformers. You've become that thing you criticize. But I would also  Do it on another level, which is that. Tucker, he was a lot younger back then, but how old was he, 30? I assume that was from 20 years ago. I can get the exact date. Well, I closed the window. I just assume that was from the Iraq War period.  So Tucker is 10 years older than I am, so he's 57. So he was younger, but not that young. We're not talking to a 16-year-old. And he was dead wrong about the Iraq War. In his own mind, he was dead wrong. He was promoting all of the things that he now rages against.  Yeah, Amalek said he was 30 at the time. Yeah, he's 30 years old. That's you're an adult. Oh, is 99 September 1999. That's a little bit surprising. So that was pre 911. Interesting. OK. He was a young man, but he was an adult and he was working for the neoconservatives and promoting their garbage. How many truth seekers were rejected by Tucker and the conservative movement that he was a part over the past 20 years. How many people, however outrageous they might be and whatever...  you know, guilt by association, you could foist on them. How many people were warning constantly circa 2006 that immigration is out of control and this is going to lead to a breakup of America, a civil war, if you will. They're just not like us. They don't have our values. We don't want to live with them.  in reference to Hispanics or Asians, et cetera. How many people who were the same people were to the paleo cons were saying, you know, these wars are going to cost us blood and treasure. We never should have gone into the Middle East, whatever. And how many times did Tucker and the conservative movement reject them, slander them,  kick them out of the movement, attack them, and so on and so on and so on. And then 20 years later, 25 years later, in this case, they adopt their positions. Which, you know, they were wrong then. So why should I think that they're going to be right now?  They're always wrong. Adopt their positions and sully them with retarded slop like Alex Jones. Exactly. Pat Buchanan was never nearly as idiotic as the Tucker or Candace discourse is now. Not even close. The Tuckster always supports Candace Owens.  He literally endorsed her conspiracy theory about Macron and Brigitte. So I don't even want to hear any discussion about people's outrageous comments or how they're guilty by association with this or that. Give me a fucking break. Nothing is as abjectly toxic and stupid as Candace Owens. So just shut up.  But it just it seems to be this tendency. And I've talked about this before. Like there's a group on Substack who I wish the best of them, in fact. But it's like this aporia magazine where they're just doing race realism now. And they seem to be doing race realism now that first off, the floodgate has been opened on social media and you just sort of can't avoid it. and they're doing it at a point where like all of the damage has already been done and they're also doing it in this self-congratulatory manner of like you know i i'm so grateful to me and my fellow truth tellers that we're willing to speak out on this issue we're brave  You're not brave. And at the very least, you're a lot less brave than the people who were doing this independently in the 90s or doing it from academic perches in the 50s and 60s. And they had no one to support them. They were really offering cries in the wilderness, right?  And in fact, you didn't support them. You were part of the mob that attacked them and undermined them and demeaned them. But now you want congratulations for basically saying things that are in 2025, in effect, curdled milk, if I'm to be honest.  Like, really? You're talking about race differences in IQ? Okay, great. Never heard that one before. Thanks. It's curdled milk, I'm afraid. It's not fine wine. Because... all of that stuff is done i have moved away from like race science and white nationalism for a number of different reasons but one of the primary ones is that it bores me to tears everything that could be said on this matter has been said  And in my opinion, sure, there are people who would disagree with that. I think it's an ever expanding horizon of race science, but I'm kind of bored with it. It's not that I disagree with it. I'm just bored with it. And these guys want some pat on the back or congratulations on or they want to be served an ice-cold beer after they've come back from their bravery quest to say things that people said 30, 50, 100 years ago, and that they were only willing to say after people, the first ones, the vanguards, got hit over the head repeatedly.  They were the ones who first went over the trench. To use a metaphor here, World War I. They went over the top first and they got shot. Now the war is over and it's just a bunch of rubble. And these guys are like running over the top being like, oh, look how brave we are. While no one's firing at them. It's just utterly contemptible, self-serving bullshit.  I actually saw this. I'll go back to this page that I was on. I think there was another thing where... Yeah, here it is. Yeah, so...  Tucker has now found this, what is this guy's name? Like Auron something? Auron McIntyre, it's some fake name. I don't even know who this person is. He works for the Blaze and he's like, I don't know, is he Arab or Mexican or something? Nobody knows who he is. That's like a running gag with this character.  Like, I posted asking my small following, like, guys, seriously, who is this guy? Where did he come from? What's his background? And, like, the only response I got was, like, yeah, you ask a group chat who's Oram McIntyre or whatever, and you get, like, three DMs, separate DMs of, like, do you really want to know who he is? Just, like, very ominous and, like, shadowy figure apparently his backstory was that he was red-pilled during covid or something and he was a school teacher or professor but i don't know these are the worst people people who are red-pilled during covid are the absolute worst i i'm i'm because they got red-pilled in just some like  they got red pilled about like the vaccine or something. And it's like, that's their starting mask. Yeah. I can't, I have to wear a mask to target. And I learned about the dangers of Stalinism or something. It's just, it's just so annoying. These anyway, let's just listen. That's what Sam Francis meant about anarcho tyranny is that you are going to have to wear a mask to target. Exactly. Yeah.  of people on the internet giving their opinions are kind of fake on some level. But there are some real ones. Who are the real ones?  Who are the real ones? That's, you know, I guess personally, I spend a lot more time in spheres that are off the beaten path. Yeah. And so I think that there are some, you know, people out there that maybe don't have massive, you know, fan bases or, you know, big voices in influential halls of power, but are speaking some of the most important truths out there today. Well, I think you're one of them. And that's one of the reasons – that's the main reason I wanted to meet you and have this conversation because as much as I hate technology and electricity and all that stuff, and I'm like –  pretty Kaczynski'd on all that modernity business. The fuck are you talking about? I do think the best thing about the modern world is the internet and the fact that people who, you know, don't have any connections to anything can succeed on the basis of the strength of their wisdom and of their opinions. And I just think you're a perfect example. So you work for The Blaze, but you're...  very widely read on the internet. How did you get here? How did you do that? Was this something that you planned?  Not at all. I mean, I've always been very interested in politics. I've got a political science degree in college and I worked on a few campaigns, but there just wasn't much going on there. And so I ended up falling into being a local reporter for a while. I covered news and crime or politics and crime. And then I worked as a teacher, you know, for a long time. But when COVID struck. High school teacher. High school teacher. Public school. Public school. Yeah. And when COVID hit, you know, I had all the opinions you'd expect from a talk radio conservative listening to Dennis Prager and Sean Hannity and these guys. And then when I watched, you know, the churches were closed and the strip clubs were open and you couldn't go see a dying loved one in the hospital. But Democrats could riot in the streets and burn down your neighborhood. And nobody did anything. Right. Like this. I've been told my whole life by conservatives. This is what the Second Amendment is for. Right. Like the.  The government has closed. I'm sorry. This is just so stupid. You know, actually, mainline church attendance and membership actually increased over that period. You know, like this whole idea, they opened up the strip clubs, but then prevented you from going to church. Like, you can find little examples of this, but it wasn't effective in terms of mainline church membership.  And I, it's also just so overstated to be just ridiculous, you know? And it's like, yeah, there was a fucking pandemic in which China was like wielding people into their apartments. And there were images fake or, or, or misrepresentations or whatever of, of like mass deaths and hospitals being overrun and so on. Like, Do you think maybe it was a good faith attempt to prevent the spread of a pandemic that we didn't understand? You know, but like, no, it was a secret attempt to kill Christ.  Again, this is why these people, they get red-pilled in 2020. I just, I don't know. They're useless. I'm sorry if anyone like that is on the show, but you're getting red-pilled by me, so you're going to be fine. But you get my point. Isn't this just stupid? I think this guy's engaging in Krypsis. Those ears look a little low down the skull.  Fair enough. I don't know what ethnicity he is. I could not name it. I would guess Hispanic. But who knows?  Anyway, the churches, guys, that we are across the Rubicon. And I thought I was going crazy because all of the people who had been spouting all of this my whole life were like, well, no, you're probably fine. We got to figure out how to work. And I just realized, OK, the Constitution is not stopping any of this. So I need to understand why. And so I started reading a lot of political theory outside of the mainstream. I read that read this guy, Curtis Yarvin. He just started writing under his real name. Used to be Menchus Molebug. And  And he had a bunch of other, you know, authors that I needed to understand. And the more I read that, the more I wanted to share what was going on. Just in your spare time. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's, that's kind of how I started tweeting and, you know, putting out material and writing. So it's just pure citizen. Like you don't, you don't really know anybody. You're just reading this stuff and coming to your own conclusions. And then you start tweeting them out. And the next thing you know, you're doing it full time and you have a big following.  Yeah, I think it's a situation where there are a lot of really important thinkers. And, you know, to be clear, I'm just standing on the shoulder of giants, guys like Samuel Francis and Joe Sobern and Pat Buchanan and Paul Gottfried, who were sitting in the wilderness for decades and decades. And that's why I think the conservative movement was so intellectually impoverished for so long. We forced all of our brightest minds into the wilderness because they kept saying things that didn't jive with kind of a neocon agenda. And they had to be driven from polite society.  And nobody said anything. And at the center of so much of that was William F. Buckley Jr., who, you know, I think had good qualities for sure. I'm not, you know, it was awfully nice. OK, this is funny because this sort of goes against what I was just talking about. These guys are offering like my critique in this like warmed over fashion. It's kind of funny, actually.  This guy hates me. I have no interest in him, and I don't follow him or anything like that, but I've just noticed there are all these vague, passive-aggressive attacks on me. Like...  I published that Sam Francis book that you read. I don't know what to tell you. It's just so funny, these people. They're like skin suit wearers. They jump in. The William F. Buckley thing, this is like the whole argument in the Great Purge book that I published, I don't know, like 12 years ago or something. It's just so funny, these people.  And Tucker says nobody said anything. Like, no, you were saying something, Tucker. You were actively countersignaling and calling them. Exactly. Exactly. Just no acceptance of any sort of responsibility. It's very funny.  I just get this weird feeling experiencing. I remember, I don't, this was a few years ago, but do you remember when the Kanye was first brought out on the scene? It was before he met with Nick Fuentes. And I guess this is 2023. And he, Milo was promoting Kanye at that time. And Milo came out in this like gray suit and he had the fashy haircut from 2016. It was almost like he was like, literally me in some grotesque halloween costume like manner just very interesting to me i will say so i'm not i don't hate the guy or anything but it in retrospect i mean he really served one meaningful role in his life which was to keep a certain variety of nationalism out of the conservative canon  Yeah, I think we can see this over and over again. I mean, you even think of a guy like Russell Kirk, right? Wrote The Conservative Mind, one of the intellectual giants defining the movement and more or less got canceled because he made one too many jokes about the capital of the United States being in Tel Aviv. You know, like that. He wasn't canceled. Paul Godfrey had a very skeptical take on Russell Kirk, by the way, this is just, it's like these guys discovered paleo conservatism in 2021 or something. It's just so stupid. Yeah.  all it took for you to get shoved off. You can have this monumental career and this critical position and you can no longer be allowed in polite society, no longer get invited to the right dinners if you have the wrong opinions. It feels like things are changing fast. Do you feel that? Absolutely. Where are they going?  They're going to go to a lot of interesting places. As you pointed out, the news sphere, and more importantly, the narrative sphere, has disintermediated, right? We're no longer completely reliant on a couple news channels and a couple big newspapers. And at first, the right really liked this because it meant that they could get around the left-wing control of all of these critical centers. But now...  People on the right are getting panicked because their narratives are also breaking down. They can no longer. You can't use the National Review and a couple of things to kind of dictate how people understand. I don't even criticize National Review. I feel, you know, I don't think people even know what it is. Do they? No one my age at this point, no. No. So they're panicked, like Meghan McCain's all upset that people are saying things she's never heard before. But I feel like people like that are irrelevant now. Or maybe I'm just hoping that's true. No, I think that's increasingly the case. Again, I can't think of anyone who isn't paid in the Beltway, who is under 50, who cares what any of those people think.  So what does it mean to be safe in your own home? For a long time, that meant good locks and maybe an alarm system. That was enough, but they're not enough. And you know that because the news is filled with stories of people who thought they were protected. Security systems do that. Start for about a dollar off a new system. I think the tail end of the boomer generation is still very much tied to the conservative institutions. They've had that cultural foxhole mentality for a long time, and they see those people as their champions. But I think everyone behind them recognizes that, hey, I followed these platitudes for decades and they never did anything for me. And you know what I want to conserve? The ability of my family to have children. Amen. Amen.  I completely agree. I've reduced my whole life down to that. That's it. That's my worldview. Can my kids have kids and live in this beautiful place called America? Will it still be beautiful? You know, will it be all low-income housing? No. You know what I mean? Yeah. I think more and more the message that we don't live in an economic zone but an actual nation is really resonating with people. We successfully somehow turned the right wing into the party of just disposable culture, disposable identities, disposable people. Who cares if the trade policy revolutionizes your town and gets rid of all the jobs and everyone gets hooked on drugs? At least the free market won, right? No, I don't care. I care about my neighbor.  I care about my family. I care about the community that we've built for generations. I shouldn't have to pick up my entire life and the many, many generations of social fabric that exists there to go move somewhere else every time you decide it's slightly cheaper to make something in China. That's not the way. All right. This is just platitudinous. Someone said he's a Turk. That's possible. Um.  Yeah, it is funny. I tweeted this out last night. I was retweeting someone, but someone said, you know, there was like, there's this blueprint for a tweet of like, America is not an economic zone. It is our home. And whenever anyone tweets that, they always show images of like 70% blue districts. Yeah.  You know, they'll show something from, like, Maine or, like, Boston. It's always Vermont. Yeah, Vermont. Or, like, Charlottesville, Virginia, which is, like, 100% Democratic run. They don't tweet out, like, Mobile, Alabama, because that is an economic zone.  on top of the rubble of the Confederacy or something. I don't know. It is sort of funny. It's like conservatives say this crap and I think they genuinely mean it, but they're sort of like the least reluctant to do anything. And the tariff situation, I really don't know what the hell is going on with the tariff situation. But the likelihood of that creating an economic recession as opposed to a revival of mid 20th century automotive factories and our Ron McIntyre's hometown. I would say the former is more likely than the latter. Anyway, just platitudinous. I mean, to be completely fair to them, like Kennebunkport, Maine is like 95 percent white, whereas Mobile, Alabama is like 70 percent black. So I think that's what they're aiming at. But it is it is ironic that it's always these like posh white towns. Yes. That are like Democrat.  Whites in red states, though, do have worse outcomes than whites in blue states. Like, they do actually, comparatively to each other, they do have, like, lower test scores, higher crime. I mean, borderers are borderers. Oh, yeah, you'll get no, you know, I'm not trying to do a southern nationalism here. Isn't the crime rate in Texas and Oklahoma higher than, like in the states, like an average in a state higher than it is in New York City? Correct. Yeah. The one exception is Utah, which are also WASPs. Yeah, they're WASPs. They only do money laundering, which is different than smash and grab the Mormons. That's high status crime.  I don't know. It's just like they these types of people are going to be oppositional to the things that they will endorse in 15 years. In the moment right now, they will be oppositional to the thing that they will come around to in two decades. And it's just very annoying. And you get to the point where it's like, all right, I don't want to really deal with you because that's your function.  apparently in society. And so I don't want to talk to you. I don't want you to endorse me. Your endorsing of me would mean that I'm 20 years behind too. Will Tucker adopt Apollo as his savior? I don't think so. There's also just something kind of like my kids to have kids. I mean, I guess there's a there's a kind of like middle classness of like they should have a home and, you know, they should do this. People living in poverty have higher birth rates than the middle class, so it's not just an economic thing. I get where they're coming from. They're basically saying that the middle class is getting squeezed, but. I don't know, no one's really preventing you from having kids. And this sort of middle-class utopia that you want to revive was really an aberration of the 20th century and the fact that we defeated Central European powers in the Second World War and we're just ruling the roost. So I don't know. Also, hasn't America always sort of been like a ruthless cosmopolitan country?  Like America isn't a place where like you have a family and a single place for generations. People move all the time, like throughout this country's history. Yeah. From like the borders of the south, you know, we moved west. The frontier. Yeah. Tamed the frontiers. And the cosmopolitan areas, people moved where there were jobs. That was always how it was. There were tons of migrations throughout American history. There's a bizarre fake fantasy that these conservatives have about wanting to live in a town that will never change and that is just immune to progress.  Right. It just gets frozen like circa 1955, like Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, where Paul Gottfried lived for quite some time. It's just like frozen and like the textile factory remains. The steel working mill is still there. It's doing some lumber out here. The little town is just like it just is there forever. and yeah i i just i i don't think the world is ever going to work like that also we want higher things like we don't it's not that i'm not motivated by you know the ability of bourgeois people to  like get a mortgage and a house or whatever. I mean, I'm not against that so much, but it's just like, yeah, they are hobbits. As someone just said in the chat, they're hobbits. And we're not really in a position to serve the hobbits. Like that's not a battle I can win.  And in my calculation, I actually do think that Democrats are better hobbit. Proprietors than Republicans. And also, like, we want to change culture. We want to change the world. We don't we don't want to just like return to a frozen America. In ice. Wasn't there a character in Batman, Mr. Freeze, who his wife died, and so he froze her in ice, and he's always searching for a way to revive his lost love? It's a cool character, Mr. Freeze. Yeah, he was always my favorite Batman villain, actually. I think she's sick is what it is, and so he froze her to stop the illness, essentially, and he's looking for a cure for whatever it is that ails her. I don't remember exactly.  What a simp. Longhouse. Longhouse. Oh, no. He loves his wife and wants to save her. Longhouse.  No, in all seriousness, that is a very interesting character. Because he's like, he's like terrorizing Gotham, but for like personal and kind of good reasons. And he's tragic, you know. I think that's what they want to do to America. They want to put a freeze gun on Elizabeth Town, Pennsylvania and like keep it in like a snow globe and like, ah, it's so perfect. Yeah.  kind of death-worshipping. I don't know. Life is about things constantly changing. Yeah. You can't just freeze it. It's a little, I don't know, juvenile. Yeah. Someone is saying you've got to talk about the Gaza situation. I guess I gotta.  There was a video I was listening to this morning just by Breaking Points. I think they handled a lot of this well, and it can sort of get us started thinking about this. Let me find it. I mean...  I don't really know what to say in the sense that there's been this major hostage exchange and that's a good thing uh no doubt but nothing's really been solved because the war is over like gaza's destroyed it's in rubble there's an offer of amnesty to hamas members if they lay down their arms they can not be killed  or things like that, which is fine, but there's no real resolution. And in that plan that was released by the White House, there's this, again, tantalizing carrot at the end of a very long stick, which is a Palestinian state, that Bibi Netanyahu has openly, overtly rejected. And I don't... There's going to be this commission led by Trump and Tony Blair is going to be on it and they're going to, in effect, rule Gaza for some sort of reconstruction. I could see this working for a little bit and we're just rehashing the past, much like in 2005 when the Gazans voted and Hamas took control. And 25 years later, you haven't solved the real problem, which is that there's no actual Palestinian state and they are in an open air concentration camp surrounded by Israel. And Israel is constantly punishing them.  And there's a very similar situation in the West Bank. And so there's a violent rebellion October 7th against Israel that goes too far and they commit all sorts of war crimes. But you sort of understand where they're coming from. And we just rinse and repeat over and over because we're not solving the issue. They just have to declare Palestinian statehood, bring in the power whatever PLO or whatever they want to do, or they allow Palestinians to have full membership citizenship in a greater Israel that includes Gaza and the West Bank. But Israel doesn't want to do that because now you have all these Arab Muslims voting in elections for the Knesset and they're destroying the Jewish quality of the state. We're just in this conundrum endlessly. And unless you crack the nut, then I don't know what to say about any of these things.  I mean, the UN created Israel. Can the UN not just create a Palestinian state right now? Or declare that Israel, you were a product of the UN, and thus we are going to demand some changes, and all of those people in the occupied territory will be granted citizenship.  Much like slaves in the Old South. Boom, birthright citizenship right then and there. It's been done before. Why not? But something needs to be done or we're just in this repeated pattern forever. We can watch this. I thought Sagar and Crystal did actually a good job on this. The hostage exchanges that happened yesterday, who are they and what kind of condition were they returned in? Trader Parsi is going to join us to talk about what we can expect next. He is, you know, a phenomenal analyst taking a look at some of Trump's comments, trying to read the tea leaves about what the next phase may look like. Trump is pulling back the curtain on how his foreign policy was just out and out bought by Miriam Maddelson, just saying the quiet part out loud. Truly an extraordinary clip. We'll play the whole thing for you.  That was pretty funny. We are taking a look at economic indicators and ask the question whether it might be 1929. Okay, let me fast forward here. Again, very... ...who has been signing up, breaking points. ...even when you're not here, we get... ...were released alongside roughly 2,000 Palestinians, most of whom had been picked up post-October 7th. Thousands of Palestinians remain in Israeli custody. Let's go ahead and take a look at some of the VO of the Israelis being brought back home. You can see the cheering crowds, the Israeli flags there.  being transported here in buses. You can see them exiting these vans to cheers and big smiles on their faces. You can only imagine how delighted their family and friends are to see them alive. It's going to be a bit more difficult. Some of the bodies of the deceased hostages were sent back as well. Some of them, they are having trouble locating. So that process will take a bit more time. This was all men who were released. By the way, there was a  a bunch of discussion about the fact that it was all men yesterday. The reason is because women were prioritized in the earlier hostage releases. So what remained were 20 men. Some of them had been kidnapped from that Nova Music Festival. A number of them had been in the IDF and were taken on October 7th.  So that's the joyous exchange on the Israeli side. We can take a look at the Palestinian hostage release as well, you know, coming back from these Israeli prison camps. We've talked quite a bit, actually. There's been a lot of reporting, including in the Western media from The New York Times, about the treatment of detainees in these Israeli prisons.  And here you can see, you know, someone's son just being lifted up to embrace him. You can also see some of the dire condition that a number of these Palestinian hostages were in, which goes back to what I was saying about we know in these prison camps, you know, lack of food, lack of water, lack of sanitation. We know about there was that right to rape protest. So we know about torture and abuse that occurred. And you can see this. That was a real thing. Right. to rape our captives that was a real thing that's not even some like wildly anti-semitic conspiracy conspiracy theory anyway hostage saying exactly that that they don't let them sleep they threaten you they say that they killed your children they say that there is no Gaza left and this is just I mean this just broke me to watch this man who was just released to find out that his three children were all killed by the Israelis while he was being held and one of his daughters was about to have her birthday he had made her a small bracelet and now he's he's broken finding out that his his family is gone um so released so you know this is the this is the reality of of what it is in gaza you know there's there's joy to and reunions and you know children who finally have a smile on their face and um a bit of an increase in in aid trucks coming in and some hope that maybe the intense bombardment is over i will say there were some indications that israel's already  violated the ceasefire in a number of ways. But some hope there, some joy, some relief, some beautiful reunions, some people coming back and finding surprising that some of their residence remains. And then you have these other stories that are just utterly, they'll just break you, you know, where they're being released and finding out the family's not there. They're coming back to find their home and finding it's complete and total rubble. 85% of the Gaza Strip has been turned into rubble.  So, you know, still continue to be a lot of pain and suffering going forward. Yeah, I mean, the entire scene is heartbreaking. You know, first of all, for the Israeli hostages, you spent two years in captivity, crazy, you know, to be able to come home. It was the driving force of the war. Then the Palestinian hostages, I mean, there's so many of them as well. And of course, you know, they haven't been highlighted nearly as much. In the Western press, part of the reason we thought it was important to put both side by side, we can feel joy for everybody who is coming home. And especially for the people of Gaza, they get to breathe for a day. Right. And that in and of itself is a huge, a huge accomplishment. And it is something, though, that I said this in our initial segment about the ceasefire when they eventually agreed to it.  We all need to sit with all of the claims that were made over the last two years. The claim of the war was to free the hostages. It did not work. The vast majority of the hostages were not rescued in a military mission. They were gotten out through three successive ceasefire diplomatic negotiations. And in fact, many more hostages were killed through the kinetic warfare.  At least then were rescued. And that's just in the acknowledged ones. I mean, who even knows? Like right now, there's all this dust up over the return of the remain. I think this is sort of bad analysis on... on some level i mean diplomatic solutions only come about through war and so the idea that like the real lesson is that there's one weird trick is that you negotiate as opposed to fight or something i i think that's actually extremely naive and bad analysis on on sagar's part And also just it was never about the hostages like this has been a simmering issue on the back burner for Israel for decades. And they have decided to destroy Hamas, but just just destroy Gaza, wipe the slate clean and start over. So whatever stated propaganda they put out in the Western press about, we just desperately want our hostages back. Obviously, they didn't really believe that. Obviously, there are like deeper war aims going on. But anyway. But part of the reason, who knows what Hamas and all of them. are saying maybe they didn't kill them, nobody really knows, but they're like, hey, you're the ones who killed them and we can't find their bodies because they're really buried under inches of rubble, which seems somewhat believable or at the very least possible in this negotiation. But the point I think we just have to sit with is it actually was that simple the entire time. And I think that is so validating for so many critics of this war because for years and years and years and years, we were told under this previous administration, we can't just tell Israel what to do. And it's like, oh no, you can't.  Now, why did Trump break? I will never know. There's reporting in the past, what is it, that he actually knew about the Qatar strike, but then afterwards he appears to kind of freak out about it and he calls the Amir and he apologizes. He makes Bibi read the hostage statement live in the Oval Office, being like, I'm very sorry that I attacked you. He creates the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue. They sprint to a ceasefire. By all indications, at every single turn, he told Bibi, it's over and he keeps saying it over and over again when he was asked in israel he just they said what what's your message to prime minister netanyahu who won't say that the war is over he said the war is over the war is over the war is over do you understand me the war is over i don't know what it is exactly that broke him it could be we talked about this with jeremy frankly, a lot of the domestic political strife that has happened now, you know, the wide awakening of a lot of the youth. But I think everyone should just sit with this. At the end of the day, with Russia, with Ukraine, with Israel, with every other proxy conflict, it actually is as simple as the president of the United States.  calling somebody up and saying, you're done here. It's over. So Zelensky's coming here on Friday. Potentially, we'll get ourselves a deal here. But let's learn a little bit of that lesson is at any point, you can stop the weapons and you can say, it's done. Do you hear me? And that's what these people, these Israel critics or these pro-Israel people have always tried to drum into our head.  Israel's a sovereign nation. It can do what it wants. We just have to support them. We have no say. They have their own internal affairs. It's all fake, right? Because for all the years, Crystal, that we sat here and said, oh, Smotrich, he could do a deal. Ben Gavir and all these people, they can do the government. Where are they now? Where's their red lines? Zip. nothing after trump just says hey it's done it's done it's done yeah and for that i mean again you killed potentially hundreds of thousands of people tens of thousands at the very least inflected immense pain and suffering and you didn't actually get what you wanted to be you said you wanted to destroy hamas yes hamas gave up power but part of the deal is that hamas gets amnesty they get to give up their weapons and they get to become a legitimate political party that's actually not the destruction  of what you originally claimed. I mean, their entire model of the war was World War II unconditional surrender of the Japanese and of the Germans. Well, I didn't see any Nazis, you know, who had to just give up their arms and they get basically completely, you know, back allowed into the government. I don't remember the Japanese militarists. Crystal picked up on that. Yeah, I mean, sure. It's complicated. We got the rocket out of it. All right. Maybe it was a good deal.  But I mean, I think there's a lot to linger on there. And I really appreciate you underscoring that point because, you know, we're not geniuses or rocket scientists here. But when I go back and think about our commentary post-October 7th, we said, number one, your goal of eradicating Hamas, it's impossible. Right.  Through military means, it's impossible. The only way you can accomplish anything approximating that is through diplomatic negotiations, through giving people in Gaza a better alternative to Hamas. And, you know, so from the beginning, it was clear. Israel doesn't want that. I think the point that they made that is actually a good one sort of rhymes with...  A point that I was making about Trump and Russia. I voted for Kamala Harris because I thought that the Democrats are better on Israel. They're more willing to criticize Israel. The Democratic Party in general is far more anti-Zionist than Republicans are. Despite the griper emergence and and ditto Ukraine, I thought Biden or Kamala in this case would be more pro Ukraine. Trump is surrounded by that next and J.D. Vance and all these pro overtly pro Russia people. So I found that very worrisome. But.  Trump is different than MAGA. Trump is this weird moderating force on MAGA in many ways. Trump is an establishmentarian in a weird way, even though he's obviously chaos as well. And my prediction is that Trump was going to go harder on Russia once he realized that Putin wasn't going to play with him.  And what do we see? I mean, Zelensky is coming on Friday. They mentioned that. That's very interesting. There is talk of Tomahawk missiles, which can reach deep inside Russia, being delivered to Ukraine. There's actually an attack using at cams that could only have taken place if they were directed by American personnel. Very interesting that that's happening. So Trump...  goes against people like J.D. Vance and is more pro-lethal aid to Ukraine than his predecessors. Remember, it was Barack Obama who sent blankets and Trump who sent weapons to Ukraine. That is actually true. That's a talking point of Trump. That's absolutely true.  And so he just thinks about these things in a different way. And his personality leads him to different conclusions than you would expect from the liberals who engage in this like half assed foot dragging basically of we're going to overtly enthusiastically cheerlead Ukraine. It's all great. We're going to give them tons of money, but we're not going to give them the weapons they need to directly assault Russia.  in Russian territory because that's too far. Or with Israel, you know, it's like we love Israel. It needs to exist, but there should be a Palestinian state and we're going to cut off aid, but maybe not. Israel will keep it going and whatever. Trump is just a bombastic bullying mob boss is better at reaching some sort of resolution than the Democrats. I'll hand it to him.  Maybe I should have voted for the bastard. Anyone else have any thoughts on this? What do you think about Sagar's, I guess, idea that like, oh, of course Trump knew about the bombing, as if Israel would never act independently of the United States. You mean in Qatar? Personally, I don't.  Yeah, that Israel bombing of Qatar, the peace negotiations. I mean, I'm of the opinion that they would absolutely rather ask for forgiveness than for permission. I agree. I agree with that. We don't know, though. Did you see...  Did you see the post that I put up there? It's a Keith Woods tweet with Adelson, Trump talking about Adelson. Did you see that part? Oh, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, that's kind of hilarious. What's your opinion on that? That's kind of where I think this is going, is that in Israel, the narrative that they're going to go with is that Trump occupied Israel. That's what they're going to be going with, and they're going to be kind of saying, oh, look, we can't do what we want because America is stopping us. Right?  So this right here is kind of the tip. Like this will be pointed, I think, pointed at as the beginning of that. Because they don't like this over there at all, obviously. Well, let's just listen to this. Broken promises from many other American presidents. You know that they kept promising. I never understood it until I got there. There was a lot of pressure put on these presidents. It was put on me too, but I didn't yield to the pressure. But every president for decades said, we're going to do it. The difference is I kept my promise and officially recognized the capital of Israel and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem. Jerusalem. It's very funny. Isn't that right, Miriam?  Look at Miriam. She's back there. Stand up now. Stand up. Miriam and Sheldon would come into the office. They'd call me. They'd call me. I think they had more trips to the White House than anybody else, I could think. Look at her sitting there so innocently.  You got $60 billion in the bank, $60 billion. And she loves, and she loves, I think she's saying no more. And she loves Israel, but she loves it, and they would come in, and her husband was a very aggressive man, but I loved him. He was very aggressive, very supportive of me. And he'd call up, can I come over and see you? I'd say, Sheldon, I'm the President of the United States. It doesn't work that way. He'd come in. They were very responsible for so much, including getting me thinking about Golan Heights, which is probably one of the greatest things to ever happen. He's just doxing everything. Miriam, stand up, please. She really is. I mean, she loves this country.  She loves this country. Her and her husband are so incredible. We miss him so dearly. But I actually asked her — I'm going to get her in trouble with this — but I actually asked her once, I said, so, Miriam, I know you love Israel. What do you love more, the United States or Israel? She refused to answer. That means — that might mean Israel, I must say.  Wow. We love you. Thank you, darling, for being here. The clapping stopped. You can hear it. Because he's in the Knesset. Right? Yeah, he's in the Knesset making that speech. They really don't like that. Well, it's just sort of fascinating. I asked Adam King about that right away, and he did not like it either. He was not happy about that. I asked him, like, what's the...  What's the political situation kind of going on over there as far as it goes? And I've been looking up articles on The Forward and things like that. And yeah, Haaretz, yeah, they're not happy about this. So I think that that's where this is going. uh is it's going to be going towards a like trump occupied government in america is not letting us do what we want that sort of thing which i mean this is just right in line with what you know adam green goes over right so so you you think that the netanyahu forces in israel are going to start going after trump in a very hard way because he's not allowing them to finish the job not just netanyahu forces but i think it's going to be a wider coalition that's going to keep the whole thing in power my big question to you is because i don't really know where this is going to fall is um is the pardon for netanyahu going to go like are they going to do like is he going to stay in power is he going to get pardoned like what's going to go on there now because that's kind of what the argument at least from crystal ball has been for a while is the reason that they're kind of keeping this war going is actually to keep bb in power because he was  facing getting ousted or whatever. Now that it's over, what happens? I don't think that's the case. I don't think so either. That might be a slight motivation, but some of these figures are just sort of above the law. I don't know what would have happened if Trump had not been elected. Would he actually see the inside of a jail cell? I would probably say no. I still would think that that would be unlikely. I could see them banning him from office.  Oh, yeah. Well, they should have fucking done that in 2021. It would have been so easy to do it, and they didn't. But yeah, house arrest in Mar-a-Lago, that would have been just weird. But anyway, yeah, I don't think Netanyahu is desperately trying to save his own skin by perpetuating the war so that he won't leave office and then be prosecuted in a court of law for his corruption charges, of which he is probably guilty. Yeah.  I just don't buy that because like there's a pre-existing dynamic that,  in Israel regarding Gaza and the West bank. It's not like he invented this. It's not like a wag the dog situation where he invented this to distract from his sex scandal or something like this is the dynamic. And I feel like Netanyahu is trying to solve it. So I don't, I don't, if that is what crystal ball saying, I think that's a little, that that's like, yeah, that's, that's kind of shallow analysis. I think what you're saying is fascinating. Like,  Let's just say this. If let's say Hamas, like they do the prisoner exchange and some of them lay down their arms and get amnesty and so on. And then some of them regroup and do something. I could see a like Likud and even broader Israeli attack on Trump. Like he stopped us from going all the way.  That's fascinating. Yeah, that's what I think. I mean, well, like I said, this is what Adam Green, this tough tale is what Adam Green talks about, right? So this is what he's been. Personally, I used to think Adam was crazy, and I thought this whole thing was stupid.  And then I read the Bible, like, really hardcore. I was like, oh, actually, he's right. And that's kind of the Bible narrative that's essentially going to happen. Just stab in the back. They're going to betray Israel. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And that's the justification. All the nations will come against them, the whole thing, right? So it's interesting because while that's all going on, who's, like, the number one player in all this? It's Kushner. So, like, to what degree can there even be a split, right? It's his own daughter. You know what I mean? Yeah.  I don't know. I don't know how that's going to play out. But, you know, for me, I wouldn't bet against like, you know, this prophecy Habbad stuff, because I've seen now for the last, you know, I thought the idea of Trump coming back to office itself was crazy. And like here, but here we are, you know, when, when, when the day Trump got kicked out, Adam was already talking about that. They're saying he's going to come back. That was the prophecy. That was the, the Tim Clement prophecy. That was the Habbad Nick prophecy, like the, the return to power thing. And that's what we were saying. And everyone said it was crazy. You know, January 6th, everyone's saying, yeah, right, the idea that Trump's coming back is insane. Well, here we are. So I'm kind of – I know that that's kind of like a faith-based argument, but that's where I'm at with the prophecy stuff. I don't think it's real. I think these are scripts that they're doing. They're scripts that they're fulfilling. Yes. Yeah, that's what you're – it's literally the plot from the Da Vinci Code.  It's not actually real, but people want to make it real by sort of enacting the prophecy. And yeah, I think Adam Green has been right. I did not think... Yeah. I thought Trump was done. I thought... I thought the documents case was like... definitive enough actually of this guy might very well be selling classified documents to the Saudis who are kicking money back to Kushner and Saudis are handing it to the Russians. I mean, this is sort of where I was. And I was like, this guy needs to be fucking prosecuted. That's why you thought that, right? Because you're a libtard. People who are more libtarded than I am, like Merrick Garland, dragged their feet and allowed this fucking thing to happen. Maybe because he's Jewish and he wants to fulfill the prophecy himself. Yeah, the whole thing is pretty wild because it seems to me like and they're almost going to get there in gathering of the exiles. Right. Like, look, let's just say so it's going to be a period of they say from now until the time that the betrayal happens is going to be somewhere around three years is what they think. And so just imagine for now, for three years of like Baph versus Groyper versus like Israel being talked about every single day. the antisemitism thing is going to grow to a point where it will have, I mean, there are already no Jews, like very few Jews in Europe compared to what there was just, you know, decades ago. And I think we're going to have that same thing going on in America for, it's going to be like, like black people are going to become antisemitic. You know what I'm saying? Like everybody is going to do this and it's going to be like the low IQ, like it's going to, that's what it's going to be. And, and like I said, I think it's going to start now with this Trump thing, him,  them saying that Trump controls Israel, which is ironic. Yeah, that is fascinating. Look at Candace Owens. Low IQ anti-Semitism is now being broadcast to suburban housewives through Candace Owens on YouTube. I mean, that situation was unthinkable. Christian pastors are giving sermons directly quoting and referencing Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens' anti-Semitic conspiracy theories or whatever.  to their Sunday blocks or whatever. It's crazy. So I think that's what it's going to be. Three years of that. We'll see, though. Was there any discourse on him doing the dual citizens are more loyal to Israel, even though he was doing it seemingly praisingly? That's the thing about Trump. He's like...  he, yeah, he does it in this jovial,  yeah, like complimentary fashion. Like, you know, she's a wonderful woman. Round of applause. Miriam Adelson, casino magnet widow, like versa. Even just recognizing her in itself is sort of funny. And then claiming that she and Sheldon visited him in the White House more than anyone else, and they got what they wanted. The Golan Heights, which he didn't even know existed before they told him about it.  And they got it through pressure and money, etc. And then, which do you love more, America or Israel? I think it might be Israel. Ha, ha, ha. I love this woman. He engages in anti-Semitic conspiracy theory via... compliments it's like someone saying that you know the jews control hollywood isn't that so wonderful like we wouldn't have steven spielberg without jewish domination of our cultural industries at some point that rubs people the wrong way you know even if it is a compliment i could see it rubbing uh jews in america the wrong way for sure yeah Well, it goes right along with the IHRA's definition of the anti-Semitism stuff that he passed himself, right? Like it's just – I mean it's crazy. He's legitimately like breaking his own rules. Like if somebody says that on college campus, he wants them to be able to be subject for deportation if they have a visa. If they do what he just did, it's just it's also there's an irony of the anti-Semitic resolution that Congress passed. Now, it's a resolution. I don't think it's binding in any way, but it affirms that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. So could you also confirm that? What is it? The converse of that, which is that Semitism or Judaism is Zionism.  Is that also true? It's not math, but you understand what I'm saying? So, like, that law, like, people who rejected that law are, like, Glenn Greenwald-type people. They're like, oh, now, like, I can critify the Israel while I'm having sex with black prostitutes in Brazil. Licking jizz off the... Sorry, this is horrible. I'll stop. Leftists criticize that law because they're like, I'm Jewish and I criticize Zionism and Israel. Like, why are you claiming that I'm anti-Semitic? Oh, I wouldn't dare be anti-Semitic. But the fact is, like, Judaism is Zionism. I mean, we read the first... two-fifths of the Torah, and it's all about the promise of the land of Canaan, of living in the land of Canaan, of being slaves in Egypt and leaving Egypt and entering Canaan. The Torah is about Zionism. It's just people who say, like, whenever you hear these people, they're like, oh, Judaism's so beautiful, but I just hate Israel. It's like, what in the hell are you talking about?  This is what the book is about. Judaism is Zionism. And does it logically hold that anti-Zionism is anti-Judaism? Maybe. It's at least a coherent logic to it. So even that resolution was in a way anti-Semitic because it puts all Jews on the hook for the actions of Israel. I mean, previously you could say with good reason.  That, you know, well, you know, God, that Israel stuff and the occupation, yikes. But, you know, yeah, these Jews here, my neighbors here in New York City, yeah, they're good people. You know, they don't have anything to do with that or whatever. That law basically says, no, they have everything to do with that. And in fact, if you criticize the actions of Israel and Gaza, you are attacking your neighbor who owns a bookstore in Park Slope, Brooklyn. So it's like the irony of all this is that even the pro-Israel faction are setting up anti-Semitism to arise on a grand scale. Because at some point, people are going to reach the conclusion that I hate Israel, I guess I hate Jews too. And that's clearly happening. And, yeah, as much as I, I mean, again, I do dislike, I dislike this anti, low IQ anti-Semitism. I dislike Tucker and Candace. They are promoting this. God, I hate Glenn Greenwald. Sorry to engage in such homophobic insults towards Glenn. It's just such a fucking fraud.  Oh, wow. Did Russia? Yeah. Did Kremlin, the Kremlin hand you the Snowden, you know, case so that you could pretend to be a great truth teller. And then you just ride that to promote Kremlin talking points for the rest of your career. Congratulations. What an amazing journalist you are. Oh, by the way, what was your stance in the Iraq War? He supported it, by the way. Interestingly, much like Tucker Carlson. Anyway.  The Yitzhak Rabin sect of the Israeli population were actually smarter. Like, they understood that, like, by playing the dialectic, they could control the Middle East and America. Whereas this, like, Smotrich, Gavir sect of, like, these are, like, the Jignats that don't understand how to, like, play the Krypsis game. And, like, they are going to, you know, turn the world against them in so doing. Yeah. They've already done it.  I mean, I think the die is cast, actually. I think the world is going to turn on Israel and increasingly turn on the Jews in general. I mean, that's literally what it says. Well within my lifetime. It's right there in the script, right? Like the trampling of the nations will trample the holy ground for 42 weeks or whatever the number is. And like this is directly out of the script. And we've just been replaying this over and over and over again. And like you could just go back a thousand years ago even –  Let's just go back to the 1600s. The reason that Cromwell brought the Jews back in is he said that it was going to hasten the coming of Christ. He said when Jews come back to England, that's the ingathering of the exiles, and that's the Puritans. That's before the Schofield Bible, right? And then before that, the Crusades. Why did the Crusades happen? Well, the Crusades partially, if you just take the politics out of it, theologically, they were on the idea that  Well, at the year 1000, Jesus will come back, and because he hasn't, there must be a reason. What's the reason? Because there's no kingdom of Christians in the Holy Land, therefore we must go take it from the Sacreans. That was their reasoning back then, right? So this idea that Zionism comes from Theodore Herschel, it's an unrealistic, it's like you're buying into their secular narrative to their religious project. They have a secular, thinly veiled idea that wraps around their whole religious project. And to buy into the idea that Zionism started with Theodor Herzl, and not that it's been this thing that's been going on for 1700, 2000 years, however you want to look at it, since the destruction of the temple, it's just like an inaccurate way to view it. You have to understand that what Zionism is is judaism to understand what zionism is because that's the whole concept that they've been doing since the temple was destroyed is next year in jerusalem next year in jerusalem to say that was invented in the you know 1800s is just totally missed the point yeah i 100 agree It is like the liberal Anglo-Jews who want to do something like create Palestinian nationhood in order to, in a way, guard off the apocalypse. Yeah.  You know, like Palestine, it's a discontinuous state, perhaps. But, you know, they might even have an army, but we can't go to war. We'll just kind of work it out and they'll have some like. If we're on this kind of shithole Middle Eastern country, but we'll be at peace and we can kind of, you know, have a music festival every summer and celebrate diversity or whatever. Like we can work it out and we can continue the liberal order for a long time if we create a Palestinian state.  That was the liberal Anglo-Jewish perspective on these things. And that has been superseded by the Likudite... crazy, habatist, apocalyptic Jewish push towards never allowing any sort of Palestinian statehood where you could meet as equals, sort of. And they are just pushing this to the limit so that, I don't know, greater Israel, the Messiah will come for the first time, I guess, in their minds. In the minds of Christians, Jesus will come back. Yeah. Yeah.  And I guess if we take your schema, Amalek, Trump is literally going to be the king of Gaza. so i mean he's nebuchadnezzar he's like a nebuchadnezzar type figure that's what i was saying earlier in the chat he's like yeah so he when he does this he's going to fulfill the antichrist role and the nebuchadnezzar role at the same time for both christian well that was babylon nebuchadnezzar was the babylonian captivity it's a little bit different he's a little bit cyrus like and i've heard that cyrus was a messiah cyrus was anointed which is very interesting in the bible cyrus played that in jerusalem did you see that  Oh, yeah, I tweeted that. But, well, hold on, hold on. You're, like, talking too fast. Just slow down. Cyrus is a messiah, even though he's not the messiah. He is anointed, and he obviously frees the Jews from the Babylonian captivity to build the second temple. And I think Donald Trump sort of... He's been compared with that figure. But here we have, like...  Donald Trump is an Aryan, like he's almost like a crusader king occupying Gaza. Like at some point, Israel is going to turn against him. Would they not? Because he's not, he's going to, he's going to deal in a Trumpian way because Trump isn't just like a lapdog of the Zionist. He's not. Even if I get it.  You know, he's pro Miriam Abelson or whatever. He's not their lapdog. Trump acts on behalf of Trump. And he's going to, at some point, run into the opposition of the actual Zionists who fear that he's not allowing them to fulfill their destiny or not allowing them to thoroughly kill their Muslim enemies, which he won't do.  It's fascinating. That's the next story. And I think that's maybe what you were gesturing at Amalek of like, what's going to happen six months from now or a year from now when the Israelis are attacking Donald Trump? That's going to be fascinating. I think they're going to point back to the Adelson thing as they're going to say, look, this is where he started becoming very anti-Semitic.  I think they're going to actually point to that moment, I think. Because you could hear a pin drop. That is a big deal. That is a big taboo to them. They don't like it. Any Jews in America don't like that. Jews in Israel don't like when they do that. It's a big taboo for them. So I do think that that was a big deal, him doing that. And it was very clearly off the cuff. It wasn't pre-planned or anything like that. But you did see that they had that banner of Donald Trump calling him Cyrus in Jerusalem. like in the middle of the city or whatever it's so crazy so they're just they're flying american flags in jerusalem like to them that looks like like to them that's idolatrous is what the way i would put it just use biblical terms for them to be waving american flags in the holy land with like a foreign king a foreign leader like that to them that is idolatry that's what that is so yeah that's the interesting prediction to make is that increasingly Trump is going to be viewed as an occupying force in Gaza and he's going to be attacked by the Likudites and even broader Israeli society fascinating well the and the left is going to attack him on this basis because But the plan is to basically give these people what I would say is almost like reconstruction era type, like a Marshall plan, but all in the Trump style, which is they're going to shave off a bunch and give it to contractors and things like that. So it's like a corrupt style. So the left wing is going to like the, I would say, let's just say crystal ball, for example, and the left wing in Israel, they're going to attack Trump on these grounds. They're going to say, oh, look, you're trying to force them to use digital currency. Oh, look, you're shaving off top for the, on the, on the contractors, all building a luxury hotel. Right. Right. Yeah. Your name on it in gold, the whole thing. And then the right, the, the rights perspective, I mean, like you, like you just laid out. Right. So, uh, I think that that's kind of where we're going with this whole thing is like for the next two to three years, however long this takes. that that israel is going to be framing that until it basically happens right like they're basically what they're doing is like memeing trump into doing it right they're suddenly they're setting the bait because he will take that bait he will attack them in that manner i think he'll like play into this whole thing so Much like I've been saying he's going to turn on Vladimir Putin because it's a very it's a similar dynamic, even even though it's very different, because Trump is like, I hate war. The war should end. I'm a peacemaker. Nobel Peace Prize, please. But the second someone doesn't deal with him on that basis is when Trump is going to go hardcore on their ass. You know?  Again, I don't think if Trump drops dead and J.D. Vance takes over, I could very well think that America is just going to abandon Ukraine.  And just sign it off, talk, you know, be nice to Putin or whatever. That would be a horrible outcome in my personal opinion. But barring Trump's absence from the stage, I think more and more lethal aid is going to be pumped into Ukraine so that they can strike Russia directly.  And I think Trump really believed in his sort of con artist like way. I think he believed his own con that he could end the war in 24 hours and be celebrated by the press worldwide. And that didn't happen. And Trump, excuse me, Putin isn't playing ball. Putin isn't doing what he wants. And he's just going to go after Russia harder than Biden did.  Yeah, Play Cold Italy. Yeah, really quick. Do you think that Trump may even be using this as a good opportunity to ramp things up with the Russians and as a pretext to kind of do emergency powers and maybe even try to suspend the elections? He's trying to get into a kinetic conflict with the Russians so that he can suspend elections. Yeah. is that what you're asking maybe not like a yeah maybe not like a boots on the ground you know like sending a hundred thousand um you know soldiers to ukraine but i don't know yeah i mean more yeah um yeah because that would be a real that would be fast like a little yeah i mean i don't know possible um do you want to talk about the antichrist or should we just call it a day i was going to talk about a little this peter teal stuff in the antichrist but i could save that for thursday you know what i was thinking so we have hamlet set up for next sunday and then i think we'll take a little bit of a break and then like a little bit of break i just mean a week break and then we're gonna hit um  Homer, but or maybe we won't. We'll just go straight into Homer. I'll talk to Mark about it, but. I. I'm almost thinking we should read the book of Revelation. I was just doing some research this morning on  on Peter Thiel's rather bizarre conception of the Antichrist and Revelation, et cetera. And I think it might be interesting just to do a line by line reading of the book of Revelation as we did with the Torah. There's an interesting, what's his name? Why am I forgetting his name?  Bart Ehrman book on the apocalypse that's actually pretty good. I listened to it on Audible. I could read it again. And it's sort of like a helpful guide to understanding that book. But, you know, it's interesting. I think RFH mentioned to me the other day, she was like, you know, you guys should read the Gospels as well, like read John and so on. And I think that's true. But... i i feel like the notion of the antichrist is in the air to such a degree due maybe just mostly due to peter thiel's weird obsession and just bizarre interpretation and misunderstanding just i think it's pretty obvious of of this um i think it's probably worth talking about i think it would be interesting to um just go through it  I think Relevations would be really interesting, actually, to look at. It's a very wild book. Yeah, it is wild. And some of it just obviously can't be understood. Yeah.  Yeah. But I think it would be interesting. What do you think about going over what it means, or it's historicity stuff, like what it was written for and the Nero stuff and things like that? Oh, yeah, all of that. All of it, right? Cool, cool. Yeah, we would bring in all of that stuff, but in our Straussian rabbinical style, we would read it line by line and interpret it and just read a couple of chapters a day. Pax Urania. Awesome. made an antichrist a good antichrist movie because i'm thinking of like the early 2000s there seemed to be a strain of these uh kind of so bad they're funny um antichrist movies like uh devil's advocate with uh al pacino and um well that was just one with arnold  Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. See, it's been so long, but then there was like one with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He might've, I don't know if he's fighting the antichrist or the devil, but it just seems like that was the era where Hollywood kind of did that kind of thing. Yeah. So I'm just wondering if there was an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie with the antichrist. What is that called? I'm curious. End of days. I missed that one.  End of Days movie, 1999. Interesting. Yeah, Schwarzenegger, End of Days. Fighting the Antichrist or the devil himself. It's just one of these bad movies.  Yeah, it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger with Gabriel Byrne. The film follows alcoholic former New York Police Department detective Jericho Cain. Oh, fascinating. His last name is Cain, Schwarzenegger, who after he saves a banker, Byrne, from an assassin, finds himself embroiled in a religious conflict and must protect an innocent young woman who is chosen by evil forces to conceive the Antichrist of Satan. Okay, wow. I just totally missed this one.  I should watch this.  I think this is a good thing to do. I think Homer is important, but we could even just jump forward and look at Revelation in the coming months. Revelation, I don't know if you just saw what I saw in the chat, Richard, but it's one of the most fascinating things. You know what I'm talking about with the Rev29, Rev39, Khazar stuff? It's one of the most crazy things. I've talked to priests and scholars about this, asking if they know that this is a phenomenon. Explain the phenomenon, yeah. So I would say probably 50%, maybe 80% of online white nationals, anti-Semites believe in some version of the Khazar theory, which is that the origins of Jews is the – specifically Ashkenazi Jews is Khazars who converted in the 9th century to Judaism and that they have no genetic lineage to the people who killed Christ. And that basically they are then taking Rev. 39 and Rev. 29. Rev. 39 is who say they are Jews but are not. And they're saying that that's Jesus speaking as spiritual Jesus to John of Patmos to tell him that in the future there will be Khazars. And this is the theology for what I would say is like 90% of like racist Christians, like racist anti-Semitic Christians. They believe that Rev 3.9 is literally talking about Khazars. Which I don't know if you know the history behind that, but the whole reason that the Khazar theory was popularized itself was to prevent anti-Semitism. The reason that it was promoted was basically to break that lineage between those who killed Christ. Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. So this is fascinating, right, that today's modern anti-Semites, basically almost all of them have this theology –  where they point to those verses as – like, oh, you think Jesus was Jewish? Well, what about Rev 3.9 where he says, for they are Jews but are not. They are the synagogue of Satan. That's the entire online sphere right now. Yeah, that's where my fascination with Revelation came from. Yeah, and Candace Owens believes that the bad Jews aren't really Jews as well. They're Frankist. It's some weird – they say they're Jews, but they're not. That's what she's saying. Yeah. And then the left wing has their own version of that where they're saying, oh, they're Europeans. Oh, they're Polish. Go back to Poland. Right. So it's just like nobody can blame the problem, which is like the Torah. Right. Like nobody can actually point at it. Exactly. Yeah, no, I think this is worth delving into.  All right. Do you want to call it a day here? We'll just talk a little bit about the Antichrist maybe on Thursday. All right. Good show. Well, I'll talk to you guys soon. All right. Bye-bye.

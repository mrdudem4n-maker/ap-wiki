All right. How is everyone doing? I'm not doing so hot myself. Just saying. I'm feeling a bit under the weather. I don't know what is going on. I'm having to take care of a lot of animals, and that includes a cat, and I've been deathly allergic to cats for my whole life, and I feel like I've overcome that allergy, but not completely. So I'm wondering if my immune system is in overdrive, and so I would be sicker, perhaps, or...  The allergy is just making me... My allergy to cats is just sort of overwhelming my system. I don't know. My other theory is that... after covid due to the lockdowns and and mask and just avoiding contact etc etc i really felt like my immune system had declined pretty significantly and for obvious reasons just the lack of exposure and i was getting sick by 2021 2022  I was getting sick about every couple weeks. I don't know if you guys experienced this, where maybe every three months, but maybe every six weeks. And I felt like my immune system was compromised, or it hadn't been exercising, so to speak. But I got a lot better from that. And knock on wood, I've been healthy. I mean, I'll occasionally catch a cold, but it'll last a day or so.  I don't know. I just feel sort of down. I haven't really been up for exercising or going to the gym, really. I've kind of walked around and done stuff, but I don't know. Enough whining. The other thing, as you saw last night, I decided not to do a Thursday call because  I'm taking care of the kids without help. So I, I sort of, I needed to concentrate. It's, it's hard to kind of sit them down for a movie for two hours or so. And, um, but also there was the Red Sox Yankees elimination game. Um, um,  And so I had to watch that. And that was happening right during the call. So they made it prime time. I think it started at six. And it was a fairly long game. So that was a tough one to watch. Many hopes were dashed. Many expectations fell short.  I don't know. It was an interesting game. I don't know if you guys want to talk about it. I think it was an interesting series. I mean, I guess the, what I would say about it is that I don't know if Chris is on here, our resident baseball fanatic. Otherwise I'm sort of. I am. I am here. I can chip in a bit if you want. Yeah. Yes. Good. I presume you watch the game. Yeah, I listened to the game, and I can't say I was really rooting for the Red Sox exactly, but it would have been nice to see Alex Bregman advance. That would have been cool. Right, yeah. Of course. Basically, my team, the Houston Astros, did not make the playoffs this year. First time since the Obama administration that that's happened. Wow. Basically, I have the choice of rooting for different ex-Astros who are in the playoffs, like Bregman until last night, Kyle Tucker, George Springer also. Yeah, that's interesting.  Yeah, so the Red Sox season was pretty fascinating. Yeah, someone is saying a play called Italy saying the Giants suck. Yeah, you guys had something going there for a while. The Red Sox season was fascinating. There were fairly high expectations. A lot of people are saying, like, we exceeded expectations or whatever, but yeah.  A lot of people were looking at them as a division winner, or at least a wildcard team. I think what happened is that there was so much drama at the beginning. They signed Alex Bregman, aforementioned, to play third base. Rafael Devers, who has been a longtime Red Sox player, and to be honest, I'm glad we traded him away. I'm really glad. But...  You know, he's sitting there on third base. That's his spot. He's been there for years and he's sort of been the best player on the team, face of the franchise, etc. And he was mad. So there was drama. Then he started to DH.  And the Red Sox got off to a very poor start. And it was just not looking good. They were well below 500. And they started to turn it around at some point. And they were playing good baseball. And then Craig Breslow, who's effectively the GM – he has another title – He did something that I wanted him to do, which is you just trade the face of the franchise because he's sort of clogging things up. And there are other pieces that you can fit into that hole, basically, and multiple other pieces. And you have this big name player who's getting overpaid at the end of the day.  for being a DH who strikes out a ton, etc. And so I was very happy with it. It also reminded me of 2004 when Theo Epstein traded away Nomar Garciaparra, who was a great player, face of the franchise, and beloved in New England. But...  Was going through the injury bug. He was almost seemingly having feigned injuries. Not happy that they tried to get rid of him back in 2000, over the summer of 2000, or over the winter, I guess, of 2003 to bring in Alex Rodriguez and a new player.  Was not happy during one of the greatest games ever played against the Yankees. It's most famous, perhaps, for the play of Jarek Jeter diving into the stands to catch a foul ball. But that wasn't the half of it. It was extra inning games. You had Nomar Garcia Parra just sort of standing on the front, on the top step, not playing.  Is he injured? Is he not? What's going on? Is he really your leader if he's not out there on the field? The other shortstop is diving into the stands and you're just sitting around. And he was traded away and it was a sort of  It was a message to the team, I think, but also it was a we we need a complete baseball team. Nomar is failing us in the field. He's not leading. So we are going to replace him with a top notch, you know, gold glove caliber shortstop.  Orlando Cabrera to just play the field. And that's what we need. We're a complete team. We're not a team of stars. We're a complete team. And yeah, the rest is history. They had an amazing run coming back from three down.  In the American League Championship Series, no one's ever done that before. Truly amazing. And then they dominated in the World Series against the Cardinals. So I was wondering if something like that would happen again. And what ultimately happened was that they got rid of Devers, and he's being paid $350 million, overpaid. His contract is, in effect, underwater because he's not earning his keep, basically, even though he is good. Roman Anthony, who is the number one prospect, he's a symbolic Apollonian baseball player, tall, blondish, brownish hair.  But his name is Roman Anthony. His actual name is Anthony Anthony, believe it or not. He doesn't go by Tony Anthony, but he just added in Roman. So there you go. Tony Tony, as someone was saying. But truly an amazing player. And I'm not even joking when I say that his potential is in the line of Ted Williams or Carl Ustremski. left fielder rarely strikes out, takes walks, can hit for power, can hit for average, can go the other way. I mean,  Yeah, the guy is in the mold of a Hall of Fame Red Sox left fielder. I mean, there's bats left handed. I mean, he's got all of it. He bats left handed and throws right handed. So you got Yaz and Ted Williams and he is confident, you know, looks good. There you go. The team was the best. The Red Sox were the best team in baseball with Roman Anthony.  And of course, he got hurt. And other people got hurt. So they kind of limped into the playoffs. And they were lacking in starting pitching, not the bullpen. And they won the first game with the big trade that is from last offseason, Garrett Crochet, who's this big 6'5 dude. He has roots in Louisiana, I guess, that Garrett Crochet.  But very hard throwing left-hander. And he was awesome. He out-dueled the Yankees ace. What's his name again? Max Fried. Max Fried, yes. Some of the best Jews.  In the MLB, we're in Yankee Stadium this series. Max Fried, Alex Bregman, and who is the first baseman for the Yankees? Goldschmidt. Goldschmidt, yes. He's not Jewish. I've checked. He's not Jewish? No, he's not. Okay. Well, he has a Jewish name, but anyway. Believe me, I check all of their Wikipedia early life.  How many generations did you go back for Goldschmidt? Right. We're worried with this one. We might need to do a Blade Runner style, like testing him, have him read out cards. Look at the dilation of his pupils.  No, um, I, I, it doesn't, I'm, I'm saying this completely jokingly. It does not matter at all. And, um, even someone like Alex Bregman, I mean, how Jewish are you when you drive a pickup truck? I, I ask, you know, so calipers handy, but, uh,  Anyway, they limped into the playoffs and they won the first game. Crochet is just a dominant ace. I don't even know what the comparison to it. The comparison is like to Randy Johnson or something because he's left handed. He any scary. I mean, he is throwing hard.  He has command, but he's, you know, he has good command. He doesn't walk people, but he's, you know, a little bit wild throwing in the upper 90s, throwing inside. I mean, he's a powerful presence. And so that was great. They had some major errors in the second game. The second game was really theirs to win.  And there was a base running issue where I still don't understand why Nate Eaton didn't score. I don't understand why Nate Eaton was playing. This is not like a murderer's row of Red Sox. This is...  They're platooning multiple positions and etc. But anyway, there was that Jaron Duran, who's probably my favorite player, had a major miscue. I don't think it was actually called an error, but it should have been somewhat difficult ball in left field and he blew it.  And that cost them a run. I mean, it was it was pretty agonizing. And then last night, the Red Sox were just revealed to be without Roman Anthony, without some other people just revealed to be a sort of mediocre team with a big time ace. They were sort of playing above, punching above their weight. And  That was not a good game. So there was this rookie flamethrower who's actually from Massachusetts. He was a Red Sox fan, but he was drafted by the Yankees with the unlikely name of Schlittner. Isn't that how you pronounce it, Chris? Schlittler. Schlittler. Excuse me. That's it. Heil Schlittler. Heil Schlittler, as no one said. Right. Yeah.  He was amazing. But at the same time, a lot of holes were revealed in the Red Sox. Anyway, there it is. So, Chris, who do you who do you think is going to do well?  Oh, you know, I just kind of, I root for my team when my team is done. I'm kind of done. I don't follow the other teams nearly as much, but I guess I would be rooting for the Toronto Blue Jays who have George Springer on their team. He, of course, is on the 2017 Astros team and a really great guy also. It'd be cool to see them win. And of course they had the best record in the American League, have to be considered one of the favorites, I guess.  It's been good to see them win. I did notice a funny thing that I think you'll probably relate to a little bit. We've talked a bit about how psychologically, at least before recent decades, the Yankees were a much bigger deal to Red Sox fans than the Red Sox are to Yankees fans. Oh, yes. Yes. The Yankees are like the great nemesis, the great black beast, the bet noir in Red Sox nation.  Yeah, because we thought we couldn't beat them. Yes, that's the thing. 1918. Yeah.  Yes. The curse of the Bambino. It was a curse. Yeah. And right. But it wasn't just that. There's the curse of the Bambino where he was he wasn't traded. He was sold to the New York Yankees so that the owner of the Red Sox could fund a Broadway musical called No No Nanette. I believe is the story. That sounds right. Yeah. It's some crazy thing.  Are you sure it wasn't springtime for Hitler? Springtime for Schlittler. There you go. Yes. So there was the curse. 1986. I was very young. I did not watch the game because I would have been around eight. I guess I could have watched it around that age, but I didn't. But yes, that was obviously just outright devastating with the Bill Buckner play ball through his legs. They were they were literally putting champagne on ice in the locker room. And there's video of it that they played on the broadcast that you can see in some of these highlights. So they were they were all but uncorking champagne and and they lost the game. I mean, just unbelievable. Supposedly, they also, in Shea Stadium, they actually supposedly ran a graphic on the billboard. They ran a message there just moments before it all happened that said, congratulations to the Red Sox 1986 world champions. It was all but official. Does someone have a photograph of that? That's incredible. It's too good to check. It's just too good to check. I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It was...  Anyway, so there was this curse. But then these Yankees teams in the 1990s, they had the biggest payrolls. It wasn't just like Jeter or something. Jeter was overrated. It was they spent I mean, they spent more money on players than like on individual players than the entire pitching staff. the montreal expos or something like this i mean that was an actual stat i mean it was just outrageous uh they were a juggernaut and i think with red sox there there is it's a certain kind of fandom where you just believe the gods are against you and it's impossible and the yankees are just unbeatable there you know at some point you're going to even be doing well and you're going to bring in wakefield off the bench  And he's going to give up a game winning home run to Aaron Boone, of all people. I mean, it's just going to happen. And the 2003 and 2004 squads were sort of crazy. They were, you know, the cowboy up the everyone is growing a beard, which is sort of an affront to George Steinbrenner. I'm not sure if this is the motivation, but George Steinbrenner famously has a shaving policy. And the idiots were, you know, not shaving or cutting their hair and they were just crazy swigging whiskey before games. I mean, it was they were they were crazy. And I think they sort of had to be.  And they did it. And then the Red Sox have for 20 years have really had the Yankees number. And so anyway, here we are. That's kind of where I was going with that. There's been a bit of a psychological change. You know, the Red Sox now have. a payroll that is comparable to the Yankees or the Dodgers, you know, it's, it's right up there. They're one of the big payroll teams. They've had a number of, they've had, they've had four championships this century to the Yankees one, you know, three, three decades into this century, only one Yankee championship. That's quite a, that's, that's a historical it seems. But anyway, I noticed something the other day at my gym, there was a guy there, a Yankee fan wearing a shirt and,  clearly very recent, said, you know, NYY, New York Yankees, and it said big letters, clinched. So it was some big, there's a recent t-shirt celebrating their clinching of a playoff spot, because they didn't even win their division. It's like, guys, the Yankees are not about clinching playoff spots, or at least your father's and grandfather's Yankees are not about clinching playoff spots.  It's championship or bust for the Yankees. But of course, Yankee fans have had to adapt psychologically to the new era when the Yankees are not dominant. Always competitive, but not dominant. So yeah, they're buying t-shirts celebrating lynching a playoff spot. How strange. The strangest thing is that the t-shirt actually said lynched. And yeah, it was very offensive.  I mean, it was either that or Heil Schlittler, so it had to be lynched. They always used to wear the T-shirts for the playoffs with the pendant on it, you know, like AL champions, and that's what they'd wear through the playoffs until the World Series, but they can't even do that. The Blue Jays won the American League, so...  clinch the wild card position. That's sad. They seem a little fake. They're an older team. They're not a homegrown team. And Schlittler is homegrown and hats off. But I don't know. The shortstop for the Yankees is Volpe. I don't know. It's just not...  They still, even though they won fair and square, they clearly beat the Red Sox. They're not really scary, I would say, outside of Aaron Judge. Yeah, they don't seem to me to have much of an identity outside of Aaron Judge. And just being the Yankees, wearing the pinstripes, that's something. But I always feel like I can never tell all their players apart.  Is that Volpe? Is that the other guy? Maybe all the facial hair could be part of that too. They all look the same to me. They kind of get absorbed into this Borg, this corporate Borg that is the New York Yankees, the evil empire. They lose all individuality. It's like that full set scene in Full Metal Jacket. True. True. um anyway i say don say don rafaela with the uh the attempted bunt to the pitcher you know i'm not a fan of say don rafaela um sam he can get he can get super hot Unbelievably hot where he is, in effect, the best hitter in baseball and then be cold as ice 75 percent of the time. And I don't really like that. The thing about Roman Anthony is that even if he's down or slumping, he's working walks and getting on base and scoring runs and barreling the ball, hitting it somewhere.  Sadan can look totally lost. He's an excellent fielder, and he can play the infield, but he's really good in the outfield. But then, where was he during the series? There were a number of just strange miscues. um so nine with a bunting error like yeah that's rough the bunting error the other thing he's fast he's he's like a he's a small kind of speed player and the fact that you can't do that is is kind of unacceptable actually um that needs to be part of your game and so i i i feel like he's a utility player i he's not really my favorite player um really at all but i mean he seems like a nice guy you know he's kind of fun and so on but uh i i just think there are a lot of there are a lot of big holes but again jaron duran my favorite player really didn't show up he didn't lead the team out there it's actually trevor story who's a veteran struggles a bit at shortstop um but he i mean he's he's a machine he's consistently good but he's not really getting to some balls that other people do  Uh, but he definitely showed up with the bad. He had a number of hits, including a home run. So, um, they, you know, I, I do think they, they have some real good, like building blocks there. Um, I am genuinely glad that Devers is not on the team and I'm, I'm alone in that in Red Sox fandom. There are a few other people who agree with me, but, um, I think he was clogging things up. So, um,  You know, there it is. I think the Phillies are a bit of a juggernaut. The Dodgers, obviously the highest payroll up with the Mets. Mets didn't make the postseason. Mets are definitely cursed. I mean, I don't know.  I was thinking back to this joke. I think you'll like this. We've mentioned this on the podcast. There was this great moment in 2001 where in the first New York Mets home game after 9-11, Mike Piazza hit a clutch go-ahead home run, one of these great moments in sports that kind of merged with politics. A few weeks after that, David Letterman had a great joke where he said, Well, folks, you may have heard the New York Mets have been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. I guess life in New York really is getting back to normal. Yes. Yes. Piazza was a fun player, but there's just something cursed about them. And they have Steve Cohen, who's their owner. who is this humongously rich hedge funder, but someone who is so corrupt, and I can't even remember the story of what he's done, that the SEC has fined him billions of dollars and banned him from ever running a hedge fund or selling an equity for his life or something.  So I don't know. I mean, I won't judge, of course, but it's sort of a bad look. And the other thing is you can't really buy a team. It doesn't quite work like that. You have to develop the entire system. The minor leagues need to be good. They need to be... maximizing talent and you you need a complete team and i feel like he's he's sort of he's doing what i guess we would all do if money were uh no obstacle we would just be spending it everywhere and everything but it just doesn't work and that they're the collapse is kind of built in and i just soto juan soto the i guess is he the most expensive athlete in the world  Something like that. Because it was a gargantuan contract. I don't know anyone who's getting paid more than he is on earth. I mean, he is great. And he also does have balls. Like if, you know, he had a big home run last postseason against the Cleveland Guardians. Hate that name.  So he clearly is clutch and he has balls. But I just I don't know. He's also the guy that is clutch in the World Series. But if you're like five games out in August, he's going to be dogging it. It's just his attitude is it's a bit much. Just very selfish. It's just not inspiring.  He definitely showed those characteristics this year. Had a pretty good season if you look at the numbers, but got stiff from the All-Star team. And, you know, his attitude was probably part of the reason why. He mentioned when he got – he wasn't voted to the All-Star team, which is – that happens, you know. But he was like, oh, yeah, I lost millions of dollars in bonuses or something. And it's like – guy man please oh didn't know that yes he mentioned the money it wasn't even like i want to be out there and meet these other greats and you know it's such an honor he didn't even say that it was like the money it's like oh yikes  He wasn't even happy enough about the money. I mean, OK, you know, you should have had a better attitude. It was getting paid if he really cares about the money. OK, but one thing I'll say, I think I'll say about those Yankee teams back in the 90s, they were they were kind of easy to root for because they certainly did spend a lot of money, but they did also have a core group that had been developed through their farm system. You know, people who defended the Yankees would often talk about the core four, like Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettit also. Bernie Williams. Did he come up through the forms? Yeah. I'm not sure. But he got on there very early on, even if he wasn't developed. He was quite a very solid player. that's true yeah so it does verify that it's like as you're saying it's not all about the money they did they did a good farm system as well yes yeah 2018 red sox very homegrown you know um anyway did someone just make fun of us for becoming barstool sports here or something uh  Oh, who needs Barstool Sports? I agree. Who needs them? Okay. It was an appreciative text. All right.  That's good. Um, I, I think the Phillies are a very tough opponent and, uh, the Red Sox, I think one, one out of three against the Phillies when they played them and they have a very good pitching staff. They're strong up the middle Trey Turner shortstop. They have two big power hitters. Um, Kyle Schwerber and, um,  Oh God, why am I forgetting his name? Bryce Harper. Bryce Harper, of course, yeah. They have two guys who can just change the game in an instant. You can be down by five runs and they can bring you back. And it's... That is...  And I I don't know. I think it might be their year. I'm just saying the Dodgers just seem down. You know, they have the highest payroll, but they did not have a really that impressive of a season. Obviously, a ton of players there, but they playing a lot in the postseason. They're all getting older. Uh, so I, I, I think something like the Phillies, um, the Brewers are sort of doing money ball in a way. It's a small market and they even lost some guys to free agency, but they're doing well. So, um, we'll see with them, but I, I think it's going to come from the national league, which is a superior, superior league this year at the very least. Um, and I, I think the Phillies and the Brewers are very tough. Um,  Yeah, someone was saying Seattle. Yeah, they've got a good pitching, and then they have this sort of magical year of destiny from Cal Raleigh. So maybe. The Phillies are playing quite well despite losing Zach Wheeler, who's a terrific pitcher. But yeah, testament to how strong the team is. Yes. Definitely. Definitely.  All right. So does anyone else have anything on baseball or I can move on? I'm just happy the Cubs won. The Cubs won. We didn't even mention the Cubs. Yeah. They seem very strong. Yeah, they're doing well.  They don't have. Yeah, go ahead, Chris. Oh, yeah. We did briefly mention Kyle Tucker, at least, who's the former Astro now playing for the Cubs. Good luck to him. Definitely. They seem to be a very solid team as well, because they don't. I mean, Tucker, I guess, is a star. The Japanese DH, like what is it? Suzuki, I believe is his name.  He's very good. But they seem to have just an... And then Crow Armstrong is very young. He sort of fell off, but he's a very exciting player. And so, yeah. I think they have an all-around solid team. Very good defense. So, yeah. I think the Cubs could go far. It would be great to have a Cubs-Red Sox World Series. just saying a lot of parallels with those teams yeah definitely benway park and wrigley field and then fan bases actually someone was talking to us someone said that like boston is a lot like chicago and they're like why is that why is i was like  They each have loud and obnoxious ethnic whites making up the core of their cities. I think that is sort of... And like funny accents, so... Yeah. So anyway, I think that would be a lot of fun. It's getting progressively dark in here. I don't know if I should turn on a lamp. Look a little spooky.  Yeah, I do. All right. Yeah, light a candle. That would be nice. I'll just let it. Let me see here. Let me turn on this lamp. The only thing that makes a potential Cubs-Red Sox series somewhat less cool is that both of those teams finally have broken their respective curses and have actually won championships in this century. We actually came pretty close to a Red Sox-Cubs World Series once or twice before that happened. I forget which years exactly. That would have been great. Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that would have been. I think it would be very interesting, curses be damned, because things are just different. Cubs and Red Sox have good management and ownership, so they're both on solid footing. I think in the 20th century, the Cubs weren't really trying because...  Like, why bother? Everyone comes to the games. They're lovable losers. And it's just sort of a fun thing. The Red Sox are more about heartbreak. Great teams getting so close and having your heart ripped out at the last moment. Ooh.  But I think both teams are different now. The Red Sox have gotten the monkey off their back and they're well run. And the Cubs are clearly well run because they seem to, you know, they won in 2016 and they just seem to be very solid. Anyway.  Okay, I wanted to talk about a couple of things. And so a couple of things. So first off, I wanted to mention something. So this Sunday, we are, I'm going to talk this Sunday about something that I want to just sort of like throw out there to get it in the ether and then i i'm gonna send out a survey and then i want that will go out onSubstack and it will only go to paying subscribers and um  But I want to just sort of get this idea going. And then this Sunday, when we usually do Alex, you, we're just going to talk about this idea a little bit. And then next Sunday, we're going to have a two week Shakespeare seminar where we're going to look at Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet. We might I think we'll do it in those orders in that order and So we'll do that and then after that so that so three weeks after that once we're into November we're actually going to turn to Homer and So this will be a lot of fun But so I'll just I'll just mention what I wanted to mention so  I have been very pleased with the turnout and the success of our in-person meetings. So we had one in Chicago, one in Austin, and both of them were basically sold out. And I think we also kind of pushed over the  We cross the boundary, let's say, of just being kind of casual meetups. And I think we're quite into this new era of we want to have more of a formal conference. This is at least my thinking. And I can get feedback on that. Maybe people like the casual quality to it. So in Chicago, we had a lot of fun.  We met up on, did we meet up on Saturday? I think we did. We met up on Saturday and we went to the Chicago Art Institute and we hung out there. And then we had a great steak dinner. And that was basically the registration price was dinner. And then after that, we hung out at a fun club. uh on uh believe it's on michigan av but it's a it's a former wasp country club thing that's now just uh open to everyone and but that was a lot of fun it was a very nice place what is it called again the uh is it like the racket club or something  Chicago Athletic Athletic Club. Yeah. Actually, if you if you go to the restrooms, you can actually go and see the racquetball courts and things like that. It must have been quite a club in its prime. Then on Sunday, we actually went to a White Sox game, and that was great in the sense that it was the tickets are cheap.  But that was a lot of fun. And Austin, ditto. We got tacos. We hung out. We walked around campus. We visited Scientology. We had our trip canceled due to flooding. We had a boat reserved, which we actually had to add another boat.  Which is very because of signups. So that is a great problem to have. So we actually had two boats reserved. And that got canceled due to flooding. And I guess I should mention the tragedy that occurred in Texas this past summer of summer camp. Oh, my God. One of the worst things I've ever heard. and uh pickleball now we should do pickleball yeah and uh then we went actually to a ranch and um the shiner ranch we had an amazing steak dinner and we were there until midnight raw oysters galore it was great and we sort of blew through the registration budget because of just everything, you know, getting the stuff canceled and then food got very expensive, but whatever. It was a lot of fun. And yeah, and then we had some brunch on Sunday and so on. Yes, someone, regular guy said his lobster tail actually did it, yes. But I feel like if for those events, if we had a dozen people, I think that would be fine and appropriate. But I also feel like just because we have more members now on Substack, we've really generated an audience that...  we're sort of at a place where we should start to move beyond these things. And I, I'm not in a place where I'm sort of struggling, you know, I don't even want to revisit the alt-right days, but there, there really was a feeling where, uh, things were growing and growing and become bigger and bigger.  And then there was deplatforming. There was all of the stuff going on. It just got very difficult. And I wanted to build up in a different way. And I feel like maybe I tried to do that a little too soon. But now we're at a place where we really can do it. And so, again, I thought we could talk a little bit about this on Sunday as well after I send out a survey. But I wanted to get this in your mind. Yeah, someone said Miami meetup. I'm down. But here is always the problem.  that we run into. So when I do something like a $125 registration fee, the idea is not to, certainly not to gouge anyone, but also to make it an enticing price.  When you go out on the town, spending $125 per person is pretty standard for dinner these days. So I wanted to have an enticing thing and basically say, well, you know, you're kind of on your own for other expenses. This gets you the big dinner where we can all socialize for a number of hours and go out for drinks afterward. And that really made a lot of sense. if I want to make a sort of all-encompassing thing, then the registration price gives you a bit of a sticker shock. So it's like, wow, $750, that's a lot, and so on, and upwards of that, if we're to kind of do more together. On the other hand... um there's just a sort of economy of scale with these things and you're going if we're going to meet up at all even if we meet up you know uh 50 miles down the road from where you live just due to the nature of socializing etc you're going to spend a couple of hundred dollars anyway but  it's just a psychological thing of, do I want to pay all this now, et cetera. So I don't want to do something that we feel like a, there's sticker shock, you know, psychological to a large extent, but also real, you know, I, I want, this isn't, this isn't something, this is not the main income source. And this is not, um,  you know, an attempt to do some wild profit. It's just a way of bringing everyone together. I think that's very important. I have a lot of fun. I mean, I want to do it just for personal reasons of getting to meet people and chatting and having fun on the town and all that kind of stuff. uh so we want to make it available but at the same time i think we could do more like i i was talking actually with the wife of someone who's come to a number of these and she was saying you know we should just do a cubs game uh you know when we go back to chicago and i think chicago is a good place i have roots in chicago i know it well  We should all go to a Cubs game. That's fun. That being said, it's funner when we're all sitting together. And that means that there's we're going to have to buy tickets on mass. You get the idea. No wives, a boys trip. That's what someone said in the chat. OK. Yeah. Prostitutes get expensive. We're going to have I mean, I know there's an economy of scale. here but uh you know a full harem that can cost thousands not to mention yeah the hospital bills when you're uh get beaten up by their pimp and etc i mean it gets penicillin is cheap though the penicillin  Yeah, that's the better joke. The hospital bills for the clap. When you have to buy that for a lot of people now, the margins get, you know, they go down, the more clap there is. Yeah. Anyway, no, women are welcome. I get the whole boys trip thing, but I, you know, women are welcome. So  So this is the thing. This is the little hurdle we have to overcome. Now, one one way that we can hurdle that obstacle is to sort of break things up.  And so you can, you know, register for like the meal and that would be on say Friday night. And then we have like other things that are added on. And so you don't, you know, if you're on a budget, which I totally understand, you don't have to do it. Um,  I don't know. The hotel thing is also that just becomes a bit of a nightmare. But maybe we have to overcome that. I don't know. I've thrown out a number of things here. What are your guys thoughts on this matter?  I mean, personally, I don't mind organizing my own hotels and things like that. Like you said, that's just logistically difficult to get blocks of rooms ahead of time. Yes. leave people to their own devices to figure out their own lodging and things like that but you know make a make an itinerary of a few activities and uh you know i don't think anybody's i don't think a couple hundred dollars is prohibitive to anybody you know five six hundred dollars for the activities type thing and then you know figure out your own meals and hotel that's a The other thing is that I can stay, you know, one thing that we noticed, so I stayed in a hotel that was on, what is it, Congress Avenue in Austin. So it was just south of the Capitol building. You could walk to the Capitol, which we did. And they had a pool there. And so, you know, you didn't have to stay at that hotel. It's not like that hotel was even... like extremely luxurious or something, but you know, even so you don't have to stay at that hotel. You could stay with a friend of yours, you know, but you could go there and join us at the pool or hang out at the bar and, and things like that. Yeah. Right. And it's just, there's less logistical issues than trying to rent 40 rooms at the same place. You know, you,  It becomes horrible. And then someone cancels and then it's horrible. You think it's easy. That's the worst part of it. The lodging is leave people to figure that out on their own. You're going to figure out your own flight. You're going to figure out your own hotel room. So it just is what it is. Yeah. but activities that we could do together is breaking them up a little bit easier because then people could buy like you know everyone has a monthly budget you could buy the registration first and then next month by the um you know the the baseball game or something if we do that or or whatever  Well, right. Cause maybe some people want to leave on like Sunday morning or they have to be back for something. So sure. You break it up into, you know, the Friday night thing, the Saturday night thing or different activities. And then people can kind of filter in or filter out, you know, if they can only get there on Saturday morning, they're not paying for the thing on Friday type situation. That sounds good. A regular guy you wanted to jump in. Yeah, I was going to say on the hotel thing, it's the most variance of cost in terms of what you'll pay. We're all eating at the same restaurant, but you can get like a $80 hotel full of scummy people screaming, or you can go all in and get a suite. Also, if you're going to break it up, why not by days rather than specific activities? Just bringing it up by specific activities seems kind of like...  excessively car mentalizing it. Okay. Yeah, I think I can't remember exactly how much I paid per night for the trendy hotel that I stated that had a pool and a bar. It was probably in the 250 range. Something like that.  300 range. Yeah, Christine. Yeah, so let's 300 range. Let's call it that. So it does sort of add up. You could easily spend $1,000 in the weekend. But it wasn't like excessive. You know, I don't know. There's a big...  Yeah, there's a big difference between that and luxury. But yeah, I think what I could do is also pick out a hotel that's in that reasonable range, you know, 250-ish, maybe a little bit more than that. And I could kind of let everyone know and we could figure out arrangements on our own. The other thing is that very oftentimes when they sell you these blocks – It's not actually that it's oftentimes not even less expensive, but surely not that less expensive than getting a deal on like hotels tonight or things like that. So, you know, it's like we're doing all this logistical work to save people no money or to save them like $15 or something. It's just not worth it.  But I think that's a good idea. Break the activities up by days and then figure out your own lodging and your own flights. Yes. And what are your thoughts on this? So Chicago and Austin. Austin is a pretty big airport now.  And DFW is an even bigger airport, which is three hours north-ish. Chicago, I think, is the busiest airport in the country or even the world or something. Atlanta. Atlanta. That's a terrible airport. Worst.  I just, I don't know. So I will send out a survey so that I will get more detailed analysis of this. I also, there's analysis of where everyone's from, but does any, what do you guys think? Like I like Chicago. I like Austin. I thought Austin was great. Now we went mid summer. So it was hot as hell.  But that's, you know, how it goes. But Chicago in spring is very nice. We kind of have a little rhythm going with that. This is also where we are. We did a meeting where we had like five or six people. And that was great. But we all hung out, had a great dinner. Yes, Fuentes joined us. And then we sort of like...  just things have gotten better. We, people are feeling good. We have more subscribers. And so we, you know, then we had a 25 or 30. So I feel like we're going to have more. And so anyway, just, you guys can just throw out ideas here and then just so I can sort of get a, I can get a vague conception of what's going on. And then I'll, I will send out a, um,  uh, again, a survey so I can kind of have a little more, some numbers to go with it. Do you have an idea of a timeframe? Like what month are you thinking of doing the next? What I'm thinking of is to do one right after Christmas. First off, I'm thinking of doing, um, Very similar to what I did actually last time, which was in later winter meeting some people in New York and doing a kind of small thing.  Um, that was fun, uh, last time. Uh, but I'm thinking of really doing something that would, that I want to get, you know, people, you know, excited about and so on in January. So basically the holidays are over, you know, the world starting up again, January, and then doing something in May in Chicago, like we did. May.  Yes, January, May, and then a midsummer, and then we should probably do a fall. So, but right after the holidays, what I've noticed with people is November 1st rolls around.  You're buying plane tickets to Thanksgiving with the fam. You're buying Christmas presents. You're going to visit your grandparents for Christmas. It's just from once Halloween is over, I just feel people are booked. So that's why I was thinking of doing sort of a smallish thing in New York, just to kind of say, I'm going to be up there. I, you know, love to see everyone, we can, you know, go for dinner and things like that. But I want to do something big in January. And I want Brahman will be there. And I want to celebrate the book as well.  So probably in latest January, but that's when I'm thinking. And then basically we like this idea of going to Chicago in May. And I do think, now granted, I'm hugely biased, but I do think that like 20 of us hanging out at Wrigley Field for a Cubs game, that sounds like a lot of fun. I think that would be classic. yeah definitely definitely interested in going back to chicago in the spring but i'm also looking forward to winter the winter event good um aa yeah hey richard can you hear me yes okay um so i've not been to any of the in-person events yet i would like to come um However, I was curious, since I haven't been to one, and I'm sure there's many people who haven't been as well, could you sort of briefly run down like an idea of what an event would look like? Just so I have an idea. So I did that a little bit earlier. So for instance, the Chicago event, we...  On Saturday, we all got together. We went to the Chicago Art Institute and we spent a few hours there. Very casual. Wasn't even like a registration thing. Everyone just sort of bought their own tickets, had fun. Went home, got dressed. Then we met out for the event itself, which was a dinner.  And we had a private room, which was great, steak dinner. And then afterward, we went to a club where that I think pretty much everyone who went to the dinner went to the club. And that was a lot of fun. That was sort of on our own. And, you know, similar in Austin, we walked around UT campus and ate some tacos and all that stuff. And then we we were going to go onto a boat on Lake Travis, but two boats. But those got canceled due to the flooding. And then so we actually went to the Steiner Ranch and we had just an elaborate meal actually.  Uh, so the, that is basically what it is. We do a little bit of sightseeing, some relaxation, and then we have a big dinner and the dinner is sort of the thing that you're registering for. And then the, the idea is that everyone's sort of, you know, together we're, you know, making plans, walking around the city together, et cetera. Okay. So, so is it, is it a weekend thing? Is it three days? Is it just Saturday? Like, um yeah i mean that that's that it is you know sort of like we show up on friday and we even people we even met on austin we all met up at a more casual restaurant on friday and things like that so yes i think friday saturday you leave sunday that seems that makes sense yeah cool regular guy  Yeah, I was going to suggest for Chicago. I think, I don't know, Richard Hanani, I think, is from the area. I think he would be a great guest for one of our meetups. Let's see if he'll come. I think he kind of would if I pester him. He would come, actually. Yeah. Also, I like the idea of these things happening off the record as well. Yeah.  Now, that's the other situation. This is something that I came to the conclusion of at some point, which is that very oftentimes, speeches are just boring. And it's just like it's preaching to the converted people.  Everyone knows all the stuff, and it often feels a bit like graduate school or something. But...  So I came to the conclusion that we should just sort of cut through the chase. Everyone goes and I'm just using like, for instance, and I'm sorry to say this, but I'm using kind of Amren as an example here. But MPI conferences were the same. We would just load it up with speakers. And that was a different we were in a different position. But I just sort of don't want to do that anymore. I feel like outside of someone giving a rip-roaring speech that – and I'm not trying to cast any aspersions here, but it just feels a little bit like you're taking an undergraduate seminar and you're all seated and listening, but it's not like someone's telling you business tips or something. So I just feel like it would be – better to just cut through the chase and but maybe it would be a good idea to add some level of conferencing to these things because what we're doing now is basically i mean there's a lot of intellectual activity in the conversation of course but we are basically just hanging out but i feel like that's what people want am i wrong  Do you really want to hear someone deliver a paper? I think on some level, especially if the book is out, it could be cool. It could be cool to have like a two or three hour like conversation about like people can bring, I don't know, their thoughts or, you know, you just host it at like the hotel conference room and sort of go over like nitpick about like what does this mean? What are the...  I mean, you know, maybe that's just me. But I think especially if the book is out, that could be something cool. So in January, the whole thing, but, you know, yeah, just a part of it. In January, the first the first volume will be out. So I think it would be interesting if we do say like on Saturday afternoon. there is lunch and Mark and I perhaps, or someone else, we deliver something, a, you know, some remarks that are, that sort of like summarize the ideas and things like that. And then there's a Q and A and discussion. I think that could be very interesting. And just sort of do it once, you know, that, that this is the meat and potatoes. And then the rest of the time we are having fun basically. Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be great. And I mean, you could even film it and then put that up on YouTube, Substack, something to that degree. Yeah. But in terms of cities, do you guys want to just throw out some cities? Not Boston in January, probably.  Not the best part. Not the best place. No. Maybe Anaheim? Anaheim, California? Yeah. Okay, why don't you suggest Anaheim? It's near Disneyland? No, I just like the beach and it's warm. That's true. The ABQ? Listen, if you want the beach and warm weather... Sorry, Paul, I'll finish.  Just, uh, you can go ahead. Phoenix. Those are interesting. Phoenix. That's always, it's always warm in Phoenix, Miami. If someone is saying, wow, I was just going to say, damn. Yeah. I was just, Richard, bring it down to Miami. It's, it's winter. Perfect time. That would be fun. Yeah. Miami sounds better than Phoenix. Well, Phoenix is great in the winter. I mean, to give Paul some credit, but, um,  California is great too. I love Southern California, but I mean, you're, you're, I mean, Miami gives you a lot of what you're wanting to get from Southern California at half the cost. Interesting. I, I like the idea.  If you want to take that further, I'm happy to consult. I mean, I've been living down here for 12 years, you know, so. Can kind of help set things up, suggest some venues. Interesting. A hotel with a conference room, I think would be a good way of doing it.  OK, I'm sure Miami is like a business city. I'm sure that's not hard to come by. Yes. Kind of a finance. Yeah, definitely. I'm a little bit partial to Vegas for a couple of reasons. It. Is totally geared towards these things. First off, I think we're just in a different place now.  where basically this is not 2016. This is not going to create a massive stir. We're not trying to create a stir. We're actually trying to do things off the record and in person. And so that is very interesting. There's always something going on in Vegas. It would not be hard to find like a kind of event idea for us to do. um now vegas can get pricey with the hotels someone was saying tourism is down and that was way down right now that would work to our advantage i think it would be actually really cheap to go just because it seems that the strip has just been empty lately weirdly that's interesting uh yeah people are gambling on their phones as someone mentioned they don't really need to go there although i don't even know how much of how much of a draw gambling was now vegas has the pool culture where you know like let's say we stay at you know caesar's palace or something and then there are uh  You know, we could all go to the pool. And even if you don't stay there, I think there are ways that you can like buy a day pass for someone who's not there. So we could sort of work that out. Miami has the actual beach and ocean. You're a little bit less contained. You have to go out to Miami Beach, though. Yeah. Oh, OK. Well, I mean, Miami beach, like there, there's a whole strip of hotels on Miami beach, like literally where you stay in a room and you walk out, you're 50 feet from the sand. Interesting. And those beaches are private beaches that are basically contained with the hotel, I would presume. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And like you get a package and you get like a lawn chair and whatnot. Um, But just to bolster the point you're making, Richard, the only meetup I've ever been to was in 2023 in Vegas, and I thought it was an awesome time. I would love Vegas again. Yeah, definitely. Vegas, yeah. Both of those are very appealing. It really can't go wrong.  You can't go wrong. I'll also see... There might be something fun if there's a fun concert going on in Vegas or something in Miami. I think it would be interesting to do that. Ditto Chicago. It might even be fun to do something more highbrow. We all... If the Lyric Opera is playing something interesting in May, I don't know, their season might be over by then. I don't know. Or we go to the Chicago Symphony is also famous like that. That would be a sort of interesting thing to do like a highbrow thing on Friday or Saturday. It's a good idea.  But I think it's good that we all kind of buy it. I do think for an event, it's good we all buy the ticket in mass or something. Someone is saying Tristan und Isolde. Perhaps they're playing that. Okay, so XTNA, do you want to talk? Oh, you're muted there.  I can't unmute you. AA, you have your hand up again? Yeah, I was just going to suggest five cities. I know Chicago was mentioned. I'd mention LA, Philly, New York, and the one that wasn't mentioned was Detroit, which I used to live in.  And I actually think would be a great idea personally. Isn't Detroit a little scary? Uh, no. Okay. Not really. I mean, there's actually a lot to see that they've actually, as I go back and forth between several cities, um, and I'm actually in Detroit right now and they have a lot of,  They're sort of cleaning up downtown. It's actually really nice. They have the Riverwalk down there. There's the Detroit Institute of Arts, the DIA, which is really, really, really nice. Huge. There's, you know, the Henry Ford Museum. There's all sorts of stuff to visit. There's actually a new museum that just opened the Pontiac Transportation Museum, which is very small, but very sort of it's very interesting. It's got a lot of history in there.  et cetera, et cetera. So. Yeah, someone just mentioned Indianapolis. You know, it's kind of a fun town. Yeah.  These are cities to maybe keep in mind for the fall event. Yeah. I don't know if anyone really wants to go there. Some of these cities are a bit underrated. I haven't been to Indy in quite some time, but it was like eight or so years ago, and it was actually kind of fun. It was kind of an underrated little small Midwestern city. But for our purposes, we could definitely have fun there. my miami slash vegas that's more i guess aggressive if you want to put it that way those are winter destinations yeah yeah jackson hole wyoming yes amazing place it's more white fish than white fish uh could get expensive but truly amazing yeah that would be fun  Um, XTNA, do you want to actually talk now or? You're muted. Okay. Okay. So. Omaha, Nebraska. Okay. wow i've heard it's actually kind of cute it's pretty nice it's interesting maybe we'll do some like kind of city like that that's out of the way um you know another one that someone mentioned and we'll we'll finish up the topic is i want to get some numbers because i i'll send this out and i'll get a um  a survey going, but Nashville, and there's actually a fascinating thing in Nashville. There's a reproduction of, is it a reproduction of the Pantheon? Or is it the Parthenon? Yeah. Parthenon.  Yeah, it's very interesting. So it's not the Pantheon in Rome, but it's Partheon. It would just be that is rentable. Now, maybe we should save that for our big, you know, like coming out party to the world.  That would be quite a lot. Now, that would be expensive to rent. I think it would be more affordable to say, go to Miami or go to Vegas. And if we're doing still sort of like off the record type things.  I think that that would be more affordable. But the whole Nashville thing is interesting. Nashville has become a kind of fun town. It's the bachelorette capital of the world, in fact. Bachelorette parties didn't even exist like 20 years ago. And now what has happened to the bachelorette party of like wearing the little, you know,  veil over your head sort of thing. It's pretty funny. Yeah, Nash Vegas, as someone said, that's sort of what it's becoming. We could visit Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro and Hawk to a girl. That would be something. Oh, I already visited her. Oh, really? Yeah. Couldn't help it.  Tiki Torch march past the Daily Wire studio. Oh my. That would have been fun to do back in the day, actually. Just fully protest the Daily Wire. Torture Ben Shapiro. How about Louisville, Kentucky? Louisville. Yeah.  You could see a derby. KFC was founded there, so there's that. It's actually pretty fun. A lot of people go do bachelor parties there because they have the whole whiskey trail. It's actually a pretty cute city. What's that Mississippi beach town? Biloxi, is that it? Or Ocean Springs?  Or somewhere on the Gulf Coast, like Panama City, Florida? Gulf Coast, you know, that's kind of fun. I mean, I would imagine that's less expensive as well. But also, it is fun. It's sort of like the Southern Ocean, Gulf of America now. Yeah. What would be the worst place to go?  Portland. Poor Hiawana. Some medium-sized town in Oklahoma. Charlottesville. Gary, Indiana. Lawton, or what's that? Or Muskogee. Yeah. Oh, man. Come to Seaville. I mean, Seaville is very nice. The only thing is that that would be provocative, and I just...  I don't want to provoke people. I would go to Seaville as a person and sort of hang out with people and so on. Cleveland. Oh my. Lowell, Massachusetts. That's a really scummy area. Yeah, don't do that. Worcester. Worcester, Massachusetts. Springfield is actually probably worse now. you know scumbags live there yeah we could um we have a mark and i have a mutual friend in massachusetts not too far outside of boston um outside of boston that that would be that could be interesting i i think doing a boston trip would be actually um fun um sure but i can work something like that spring or fall or fall you don't want to do that and in the winter of you know yeah i mean as a massachusetts resident i'm just you know you know yeah it can get kind of bitterly cold yeah do something summary um yeah uh gary indiana little rock arkansas yeah there there could that could be some be some bad some bad vibes um  Richard, if we want to attract the incel demo, we need to go to Thailand. Oh, God. The problem is we would have like 20 registrations, but then only like 17 would actually come home. Like it would be a one-way ticket. Yeah, that would be bad. So basically we'd be doing the world a favor. 20 minute 17 ish leave yes some would become lady boys they would just like fully just be imbibed by the the the thailand atmosphere and just become street prostitutes certainly that's better than them bringing their thai brides back to america that is yeah yeah that would to Haiti to Haiti um wow um that would be uh that would be something Richard what do you think of Tampa or St. Petersburg Florida I'm not against it um I think it I mean I've been to Tampa and it  I don't know. I went to downtown Tampa a little bit and I went to this like this is a while ago and it was like the oldest restaurant in North America or something.  Isn't it the oldest town or something? St. Petersburg? I think it is. Yeah. It's like Spanish. Yeah. That's interesting. Or St. Augustine. Yeah. St. Augustine. I think it was where I went to St. Augustine. I'm not against that. I could talk to Kyle since he's a Floridian. He might know more about these kinds of things.  Yeah, a camping trip. You know, we could do an interesting, you know, whitefish thing or something like that. That would be very easy for me and do some hiking or, you know, camping in Glacier Park. Relive the opening scenes of The Shining. All good stuff. Okay. Okay.  I was going to say, just tie it up. I mean, for my money, I think the top three... Oh, sorry, go ahead. I was doing a shining impersonation of Richard, but you're good. Sorry. Okay, nice, nice. Anyway, for my money, the top destinations that were thrown out were Chicago, Vegas, and Miami. I agree with that, actually.  I kind of like Austin, though. It's fun. Austin has an interesting vibe. It's like a little bit of California and Texas, and I like the idea of Austin. I thought that was a good place. Chicago is a great city, and... it we seem to be kind of like getting a rhythm there and uh so i think that would i i'm just sort of used to doing that it's worked out well so why not do it again um yeah vegas miami beach in miami that sounds like a lot of fun that would be new for me so yeah chicago's just not a good choice for uh january no absolutely not bitterly cold yeah yeah okay alex jones is a special guest uh i don't think so um all right so uh what else is going on i we can do this sort of casually tonight i'm a little bit under the weather um what is sort of yeah the government shutdown um i i think  We can talk about that. I have this interesting video. I think the government shutdown is interesting because I genuinely believe that it's different this time. Don't you? Because this has been occurring for a number of years.  The Tea Party Congress was into the shutdown. I think there was a shutdown into the Bush administration as well. But effectively, the government runs out of money. There isn't a new continuing resolution. And you have a situation like this and both sides play it up. and so on but i genuinely think that it's different this time in the sense that we're post doge and we're post project 2025 and so you know the the republicans sense really since the new deal to be honest but definitely since the 70s and the creation of the conservative movement they have constantly talked about limiting government firing the bureaucrats sending them all home etc and there was probably a little whiff of that with the trump first trump administration although that was overwhelmed by trump's desire for stasis there was a government shutdown in his first term  In 2018, when he was not getting wall funding and Trump, in effect, lost. He felt like he was politically losing and he backed down. And I think his Rose Garden address was one of the lower points of the presidency, to be honest. Things are different now. And Doge was I mean, Doge was a failure. I forgot how much money Elon promised to save everyone, you know, $3 trillion he was going to cut or something like that. But he also got the idea out there. And he also showed a kind of failing way of actually limiting government. He didn't... change government because government is fundamentally about the military social security medicare and medicaid and that's it the government is to a humongous extent a check writing machine and if you're not going to really address those things then you're not really playing in the game and so  And he wasn't. I mean, cutting USA, that's a drop in the bucket. And we've talked a lot about this. There's a reason for USA. There's a reason for USAID, I guess I should say. There's a reason for USAID as a way of projecting power for the American empire and making America attractive to the world now. Is this sort of an outmoded Cold War idea, perhaps? but he was directly confronting the American state, the administrative state, and the American empire. Now, he also showed a kind of failing path in the sense that due to Elon's own narcissism and just weird, sort of surprising, inexplicable desire to be front and center at everything,  I mean, whatever you want to say about Steve Jobs, his keynotes were genuinely compelling. They were fun to watch. They were fairly intelligent. Steve Jobs being interviewed at one of these tech conferences is still to this date watchable.  He's a smart guy. He has a certain charisma, and he doesn't have the kind of Asperger-y type presence that Elon Musk has. Now, Elon Musk, I find to be just utterly, irredeemably cringe whenever he speaks, jumping up and down at Trump rallies. These Tesla events are ridiculous. You know, coming into CPAC with a chainsaw and going, I mean, it's just, yeah, it's cringe inducing. But he wants to be on stage. He wants to be front and center. He wants to directly tell you what he's doing. There's another guy named Russell Vogt.  And he is a Heritage Foundation person who works in the Trump administration. He was a very important author and organizer with Project 2025. Thousand page document in which conservatives talk about their wet dreams and so on. He is not a narcissist. He is not a theater kid.  or a kind of reluctant or disappointed theater kid as Elon is. And there's also a conception that he has of the unitary executive where the president is in charge of the executive government and can eliminate agencies at will. He is the CEO. There's a lot of... Dovetailing with Yarvin like ideas of having a CEO president who's just going to retire all government employees now.  Maybe replace them with AI. If the government is, if the deep state is at the end of the day, a big check writing machine, then why not just have computers do it? Why are we tolerating this class of bureaucrats? Not extremely well paid, not terribly corrupt, if we're being honest and fair, maybe around the edges. But people who think of themselves as independent, as nonpartisan, even if they are largely liberal, but as thinking of themselves as independent of the president, not beholden to his agenda, but doing the good work for the American people, acting as bureaucrats.  Why does that exist? Isn't the president the CEO? If Tim Cook is in charge of Apple, then he's going to put in people that he wants, that he likes, that are going to fulfill his agenda. There's no independent quality to an Apple bureaucrat. He's not operating on behalf of Apple customers against the wishes of Tim Cook. No.  There's a top-down structure to these ideas. And we can Section 7 them and fire them, fire most of them, and replace them with loyalists and do Trump's work and save the taxpayer billions. Why not?  Vote operates behind the scenes in the shadows. He is cagey. And the conservatives have been wanting to do this for quite some time. They didn't just discover this idea as Elon did a couple of weeks ago and now decide that they're going to be radical libertarians.  they might very well want to go about drastically reducing government. And what's the best time to do it? When everyone's gone. Also, when people are fed up, the government's closed. It's not, you know, a lot of the functions remain, of course, but the government's closed. It's not doing anything. Life...  moves on, the world keeps on turning, why do these people exist at all? We're not living in the heyday of the expansion of government when something like a welfare state, the great society, was a new idea. It was aggressive. It was moving forward out into the world  affecting people's lives directly. We're not in that point right now. We're not in the point of the expansion of the liberal state. We're at a point where people question the liberal state's legitimacy. So why not just dump it? I'm not saying I necessarily agree with this, but I think that's the attitude that is going on right now.  But I don't know. What are some of your thoughts on this?  I would agree with you that it kind of seems like it's a continuation of Doge. It's Doge 2.0 that the first attempt clearly didn't work. So this is the more radical way of going about that. But I don't think that they have the stomach for what that actually entails. And when the EBT checks stop flowing, are they going to do the crackdowns required to...  keep the filthy masses in line. I think you saw this with the summer of Floyd that no, in fact, Trump does not have the stomach to do what is required to keep these people to do what needs to be done to stop madness or chaos, which is inevitable when you turn off the spigot, so to speak. Yeah. Yeah. I have something else to say on this, but I'll, I'll get some, if some people have some comments here, like regular guy, do you want to jump in? Getting to what the previous caller says about EBT, EBT are just crumbs. I mean, and Musk is getting to something when a lot of the government positions is the average citizen really affected by them. It's kind of just, um, a tiered UBI system of, you know, the good boy, people with the most good boy points get these jobs in Washington, D.C. And they have benefits that your average American would kill for in terms of job security, medical. And that also goes in the fact we in the U.S. have a two-tiered labor system where, you know, if you're a Walmart worker and  You're too rich for welfare, but your company might not give you the best benefits. And when a lot of people said, you know, we should do a UBI thing, it really – where everyone gets the same check, it really kind of gets with the American spirit of egalitarianism. There were people on Reddit when the doge cuts was happening first. People complaining about other people that were in the private sector saying, good, if I don't get job security, why don't you? And these like government workers were horrified. But the person complaining about them and being nasty to the state worker was getting to something about the egalitarian nature of the U.S. And it's egalitarianism leading the spite. But it's still a critique of that thing. A lot of these jobs are just patronage and it's kind of like a tiering of welfare systems where if you're a senior, you'll get social security. But if you're – it's like impossible to get money from club fed if you're an able-bodied adult who can work. But then if you're an able-bodied adult, you can get jobs at club fed and a lot of it is – a lot of those jobs are make work –  No doubt, because I don't think we're finding the best and the brightest. And I don't think welfare statism is really a new transformative idea in the way that it was in the Cold War. You know, as I was talking, I think on Tuesday, it's like we can't have blacks in America suffering through segregation and being dirt poor. They that's a revolutionary class of people, and we could oppress them or we could do the soft option, which is give them some affirmative action, give them some welfare, transform their world and. Sooner than later, they're all going to be middle class and we'll forget about all of these problems, etc. That was the idea. Now, there are reasons why that idea didn't work. There are reasons why that idea can never work if we're being brutally frank about race differences and IQ, to be honest.  But it is a powerful notion. I just don't think we're there right now. Like even UBI, don't you think UBI, the fact that that was even like popular for a time, it's kind of fashionable, but it still I think is popular in the sense that it rings true. It's sort of an expression of the fact that the government has lost legitimacy and we don't really know what the hell we're doing. You know, it's just like, you know, one of the people who is most directly associated with UBI is Charles Murray. Charles Murray wrote a book in the 80s called, was it called Falling Apart? Is that what it? No, no, that was the later about white America. What was it called? I'm forgetting. It was a critique of the welfare state. It was before the Belgrade.  Losing ground. Losing ground. OK. Very similar sentiment. And in the title, that is. But it was a critique of the welfare state that came in the 1980s when it was they were losing ground and is falling apart. It wasn't working. The basic assumptions of the welfare state were being proven false. The bell curve came next as maybe a way of explaining why we were losing ground with Richard Herrnstein. But I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, Charles – it's an expression of the failure of these things and the lack of legitimacy. Charles Murray is basically a free market libertarian. He's not an anarchist. He wants there to be a government for war, maybe, or – You know, not sure how if he's dedicated to destroying the post office, but, you know, there should be a government, but it should be very small. Welfare should be minimal if just non-existent. And if there is this demand for some sort of handout, then why not just make it like the public sidewalks? I walk the public sidewalks. Homeless people walk the public sidewalks. People whose net wealth is a million times mine walk the public sidewalks. We all go to the same parks. We all have in, we're all benefiting from the grid, the electrical grid for, and, and the tubes of the internet and on and on public universities are another example.  We all can go to the same library at the University of Alabama. We can all sit in the same stadium to watch the football game. I mean, it's socialism, but it is egalitarian, and there is wealth differences, of course, but we all get the same thing. Why not turn the welfare state into the sidewalk, in effect?  So literally everyone will get $1,000 a month. And it will just spit out and you'll get it. So you're never going to starve. You can survive on $1,000 a month. Ramen noodles alone, you could eat ramen three times a week. And what would that be? Like $12 a day? I mean, you can do it.  and it would just be a basic floor of existence, and it would no longer be contentious. There's no more welfare queens. Yeah, rent is expensive. I definitely get it, but we're talking, someone said, someone's critique was rent is a lot more than $1,000. I totally get it, but it just is what it is. You can figure out some way to get by on that. and it would be an absolute floor, and it would inspire people to work their way out of that, but no one's gonna actually starve. But again, it's almost cynically offered by someone who's against the welfare state itself, but I get where he's coming from. I think Charles Murray,  is a critic of the welfare state. The fact that his ideas are popular are just an expression of the lack of legitimacy of the welfare state. I don't know. Why not at this point? I don't have a really compelling reason to say no to it. There are no more welfare queens. You're one person. Now, I'm sure someone's going to abuse it and like take the thousand bucks from a dead person or steal the thousand bucks from someone. I get it. But abuse is built, baked into the cake. There'd be a lot less of it. And it wouldn't be like you would just be paid for being you.  You exist. You get this. You're not paid for behaving in a certain way. So it is libertarian. If there is such a thing as libertarian socialism, it would be this. AA, do you want to jump in? yeah um about this it reminded me of the trump tariffs which are right now hurting farmers who are all over the news who all voted for trump um and who are demanding bailouts so i guess they like socialism when it you know when they're hurting the news media because they are cowards will never ask these people  Why did you vote for the man who said he was going to cut or he was going to do tariffs? That would create a retaliation and so people aren't buying your soybeans. Yeah. But the media will never do that because they're cucked. Because all their executives like Trump. It's interesting about the libertarian angle. So The sort of left-wing critique of libertarians, first of all, is that libertarianism was originally a left-wing idea. But it's also that many libertarians are essentially fascists. And what they mean by that is that It's interesting, and you can see this with Tim Pool and others, and maybe Charles Murray's race science is indicative of this to a degree, and that is that whenever they have the opportunity to oppose government overreach, such as the police killing black people or ICE deporting immigrants, You know, things that you would think libertarians who don't like big government would be opposed to, they're all for all those things. So you're not really a small government person. You just want, you just, you don't have the courage of your convictions to say, I hate black people. I hate browns. I kind of like gays, maybe because I am one and corporations are good or something like that. Just some, just some nonsense nonsense.  concoction of ideas that are all contradictory and make no sense. You're a kind of middle class fascist. And I think maybe there was a lot of middle class fascism in the age of fascism that is the 1920s and 30s. And yeah, just to reiterate what you were saying, they have an idea of like dad working nine to five in the city and mom and the kids staying home in the burbs and immigrants getting their faces bashed in. And, you know, maybe one of your sons joins the military or so on. I mean, that's sort of what, that's their basic assumption. And they want the free market with corporations, right? But they don't really want like the full unbridled anarchy that someone like Murray Rothbard genuinely wanted. Anarchy in all ways of life. They want a sort of bourgeois corporate fascism. Um, not, not necessarily corporatism of the marriage of the state and corporations, although that always happens to some degree, but they don't, they don't want it to a big degree, but they just want the world to function. And they believe that if we cut out welfare, all of those welfare Queens would move to the burbs and have two children and, um,  have a husband who worked hard and so on. That's what they want. That's the fantasy that they want to bring about by ending government. So everyone wants something. Everyone has an ideal in mind. And they feel like public policy can...  bring that about. So it's not like they actually want freedom. What they want is a system that buttresses, in fact, enforces the way of life that they want to see. Yes. And I mean, they believe limited government should basically limit people's sex law as well.  with the anti-gay and the anti-trans stuff. So that, you know, and the slut shaming and all of that, which is just wildly brought out of proportion and ultimately about resentment, if we're being honest. But I think something that's interesting, and we'll see what happens in New York, but Mom Donnie is having a bit of a moment. And, you know, I know you've likened J.D. Vance to a sort of white Obama. And I would liken, and I know Obama was...  You know, he was called a Muslim, whatever. But Mamdani is a sort of Muslim Obama in the sense that the sort of liberal idea of a black president is similar to JFK, which is that once JFK became president, both the Irish and Catholics were  which was a huge Venn diagram, but it wasn't totally a Venn diagram. There was a lot of Polish Catholics and Italian Catholics, but the Irish were, when you thought of American Catholics, you usually thought about the Irish. Um, and so, you know, when JFK became president, finally, not just the Irish, but the Catholics are sort of, um, welcomed into the fold of America. We have been sort of accepted. Um, um,  And with Obama, it was a similar thing. It's like it was a sort of liberal, very mainstream liberal idea of we get a black president. Finally, maybe we can get past the race question. Oh, yeah. It doesn't it doesn't exactly work because there's such a contrast between black and white and the history is too deep. And I think liberals were a bit too optimistic and naive about it. But that that that sort of hope and change, that's really what that was to the liberals. mind it really wasn't about populist economics it was about that sort of bridging that racial divide and i think mom donnie also offers us in the sense that new york is known for since 9 11 a muslim terrorist operation you know and he's muslim and so the idea of new york you know um Voting in a Muslim mayor is a sort of overcoming on the city's part of the, let's be honest, virulent Islamophobia that existed. And especially the sort of racism that existed with stop and frisk and, you know, Bloomberg and Giuliani and sort, which, you know,  Broken windows theory is true. Broken windows policing doesn't work. It's like broken windows. Yeah, fix the broken window. Don't send the cop after someone. That's the kind of idea that a leftist would say. But anyway, I think Mondani is sort of having his moment. And one of the things he's talking about is decommodification. Not exactly with those words, but it's a sort of, you know, we're going to freeze rents. You know, we're going to have the government get involved in grocery stores. And it's it's a middle class promise, but it's also a proletariat promise of, you know, the government really can actually take care of you. And it doesn't have to be a sort of tokenistic patronizing, ultimately degrading handout of here's an EBD card. And oh, by the way, you can basically only buy, you know, 7-Eleven garbage with it. You can't actually buy, you know, hot meals or whatever, because we're because that's healthy or whatever.  I don't know. But getting back to the Trump stuff, there's a total disconnect in the minds of his base between what he's doing and what's actually happening, which is his policies are hurting them, clearly.  at least in terms of the farmers. And when you shut down the government, yeah. How many Trump supporters are on social security? The older ones, how many of them live in a trailer park and rely on welfare and they're going to be screwed because of the government shutting down, you know, and there, and, and, Trump is having his government stooges send out emails and, you know, and on the top of the government website saying the radical Democrats did this. The Democrats. I don't know. I thought government agencies were supposed to be nonpartisan. That's just that's that was my thing. Yeah, but this is the thing. It's like for 40 years. and and probably longer because there there was a conservative movement before the 1970s but in the 1970s when the fdr coalition started to break down this was all codified as left and right basically And so the ideal of these agencies of a great society is that they are not partisan and that they are totally value neutral. But these things have been codified in people's minds where like the FBI is a bunch of liberals or something, even though there's actually never been a non-Republican FBI director in And if I were just to guess, I would imagine that 80% of the workers there are Republicans, went to a state school and are right wing, basically. But it's just been codified in people's minds. I mean, that's the FBI, which is a thing all into itself. But yeah, I mean, and I think even the polarization that's existed is part of the delegitimization of these things. Yeah. It's not thought of as a great society that we should be proud of and sent us to the moon and is fighting the commies or something. It's like, oh, yeah, it's just some Democrat thing where you have some annoying gay bureaucrat administering your life or something. It's lost legitimacy even if these people rely on it.  Like getting rid of the Department of Education or whatever. I mean, a lot of these people are, the conservatives genuinely want homeschooling and private education across the board. Trump voters, including myself, I'm not a Trump voter, of course, but including myself, rely on public education. Period. You know? We all do.  Yeah, and I'm actually very pleased with it, in fact. Just a shout out to teachers. Now, I don't live in Manhattan where they're just transing every person who walks in the door with a trans gun.  It's not set to stun. It's set to trans. And, you know, you can't get out of there without performing, being forced to perform a drag queen presentation just right then and there. I mean, that's Manhattan. I mean, where do I sign up?  Sounds fun. But no, I mean, jokes aside, in most all of the country, even if there is some liberal stuff that kind of, you know, people rely and in fact are pleased with and love their public school. And the idea of these radical conservatives getting rid of this and making you pay tens of thousands of dollars a year is just not something that these people, including myself, could just really do without substantial sacrifice or hardship even.  So yeah, we're in a very interesting situation. And I mean, I was just throwing it out there. I mean, maybe the age of the bureaucrat really is the 20th century, because none of these welfare states around the Western world...  are aggressing. They're not expanding. There's no progressive movement that thinks government can really, in the way that the Great Society did, can really change your life. And so we're just kind of maintaining it. But maybe the age of the Great Society is over, and maybe we should just have an AI machine just cut checks for people.  Maybe that bureaucrat is useless. And he's just sort of a midwit at the end of the day. So I don't know. I have mixed feelings about these things. Mondami... Yeah, go on. Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, isn't this ultimately... a proper understanding of, of the new deal in the sense that the new deal was a effort at coalition building and all, but ultimately on FDR's part, an effort at saving capitalism. Absolutely. Because capitalism destroyed the United States through the great depression. Almost almost, There are libertarians who will talk about going back to the gold standard and they are lunatics. If we didn't go off the gold standard, we'd still be in the Great Depression right now. We'd be in the 1890s where farmers in Kansas would be demanding full on communism. basically because they're eating dirt yes but i mean and that was the popular that's the populist movement it's not i'm not even really exaggerating actually it's a remarkable period of time but you had the trump base basically demanding communism against the fat cats for good reason yes it's to their interest But I mean, isn't, I mean, the New Deal as saving capitalism was, you could argue, at the time, the correct course. However, isn't the existence, for example, of the abundance agenda, which is basically just a sort of liberalism, a neoliberalism repackaging itself as proletariat.  That's all that is. It's anti-bureaucrat as well. Now, I haven't read the book, nor will I, but it's basically like there's so much red tape in creating these pop-ups that  And I remember this one thing that the Abundance Bros were mad at. There was like a bureaucrat who was saying, well, you know, there was this big development outside of Los Angeles, I think, or so. And we got him to tone it down. You know, it was going to have all this housing supply, but we toned it down. And there's some more... parks and it's not going to be too you know the building will be seven stories as opposed to 25 or something and the abundance bros are like oh my god you're just raising prices on everything so the abundance bros their idea is not new nor is it terribly interesting nor is it necessarily wrong it's basically that the bureaucrats have no purpose and the real liberalism that we want is one that gets out of the way and facilitates creating condominiums in Northern Virginia so that a Indian gay couple can work at Amazon and Netflix and chill. That is the abundance agenda. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. And going back to the FDR thing, I mean, isn't the proper critique now, perhaps, at least from a sort of left-wing perspective, the idea that sort of capitalism itself has sort of run its course? It's had a great time. Even Marx would say it got the most people out of poverty ever. And if Marx was alive today, I think he would... write books about that no doubt probably write another book capitalism capital 2.0 or something but it's sort of run its course it's been nice you know we have a lot of stuff but people are not happy with it and maybe there's a you know something else needs to happen um a new form maybe a sort of market socialism but but what is there i mean the the other to like criticize this in a way as well i mean this gets to my discussion of of like the radicalized normie and so on and even with mumdami because like it's wrong to say that all of mumdami supporters are low income in fact you have a lot of middle income people making 80 100 120 000 a year who love him  And why not tax the millionaires more? You know, it's no skin off my back. Let's go tax them. And there's also a kind of like, I guess what I was getting at with the discussion of the radical normie and the Luigi situation was that you have all these people and they're millennials or Gen Xers to a large extent. There's some Zoomers in there.  But they're like, how do I put this? They're like non-ideological Marxist in this weird way. Like they have their mind has not escaped the capitalist ideology. Right.  But it no longer works for them. And I get it. You know, it's like I'm making 65K a year. If someone told me that I was making that, you know, 15 years ago, I would have laughed at them. I thought it was impossible when I was just starting out at an unpaid internship. But here I am. And yet I can't afford jack shit.  And over in China, they pay $300 a month for rent and food is cheap. And look at those LED lights on the building. There's this like, they don't actually want to transform the world and even overcome the division of labor, which is, if you could define communism, that's what it is.  They just want their middle class lifestyle given to them in a way by Mumdami. So Mumdami, and here's this dovetails even with the abundance agenda. So there's so many taxes or there's so many bureaucrats and regulations with halal meat. But we want to get that price down from 14 to seven bucks.  So that these bourgeois assholes can buy street food in a hip way. It's this weird thing. I mean, it's understandable, to be honest. I don't want to criticize them too hard. I get where they're coming from.  But it's a sort of like mad, angry, we're going to kill you at this point with a lot of them. Luigi is awesome. Free Luigi. But it's like we're going to engage in this far left activism so that we can like eat ethnic food.  It's just bizarre when you kind of think about it. But I think even that is an expression of the fact that there's no, like, civilizational or revolutionary impulse within the welfare state itself. It's not. That's like the 1960s. It's not expanding. It's not cool. It's not interesting. But then there's nothing else. There's no utopia on the left. Right.  What do they want? China? Like a fake civilization? Like, you know, Potemkin village? I mean, I agree with what you're saying, but just to push back a little bit, I mean, it is true, and I think this is... I mentioned the Trump voters and the farming tariffs for a reason, and that was because... historically the peasants have not really been revolutionaries i mean it's usually more educated people especially in recent times i mean even mark talked about this with the agrarian question i mean the peasants are backwards they're traditional they are not educated so they they don't even have an understanding of um you know a different world and they're often your enemy because they'll side with the king oh the king gave us you know he marched into town you know on his horse and whatever and he gave us a bunch of stuff oh isn't he wonderful you know even though he's sending you to die in wars that he started for no reason um in in the so i i guess asking you know poor people  to be on board is a bit too much because they don't know anything. I suppose the educated midwit you're talking about, maybe it's a sort of last man-ism in the sense that in the past, educated people could look at the world and see in their own sort of neighborhood or their own, maybe a sort of few neighborhoods over, they could see desperation on the you know in terms of like survival whereas now you can't really do that in america again because of the welfare state so it's you know what are we supposed to do um well we can just go get an ebt card or whatever we don't really need to engage in any kind of revolution yeah  Um, but I do think that they are these midwits. I mean, they're obviously not leaders. That's the first thing to point out. They're not golden souls, but I do think if you had the right leadership, you could galvanize them towards something revolutionary. Possibly. I think that, you know, but there's the, you know, I get what you're saying in terms of they're too comfortable for their own good. Well, they're too comfortable with their own good, but I guess what I'm saying fundamentally is that there's no utopian longing on the left either. Someone in the chat recommended that we look at this Douthat-Hassan Piker discussion or debate, and I'm definitely willing to do that. Maybe not the whole thing, but just some of it. I think he'll get to the essence of what he's saying, but... What I mean is that there is even a revolutionary impulse in the progressives who were influenced, no question, by the populace of the 1890s, were kind of acting on their behalf in a way decades later.  And they were on the march. I mean, they're transforming society. The welfare state or the great society, rather, arising in the Cold War, that was linked up to fighting the Ruskies abroad. We are going to have this...  bourgeois, egalitarian society where no one's left behind. There's going to be no revolution. It's going to be attractive to the rest of the world. It's going to be fair. We're going to sort of do egalitarianism in our own way. There was revolutionary potential there. And I just think these things have all fallen and it's all gone. And I don't want to be too like, I feel like I'm getting old or something and I'm bashing the young people. But it's like, listen you know getting your health care coverage like that that's just not i i get it i understand why you are mad but that's just not really good enough if you're not suggesting a new society that is going to be technologically and economically transformed you want cheaper halal meat are you fucking kidding me  You know, I mean, it's like that you're paying for in cash from some street vendor. Like an actual revolutionary would definitely want to get rid of our health care system and would want to get rid of the halal street car system as well.  There's just no utopia for them. I don't see what they really want outside of this disappointment that the American dream isn't working for them anymore. And I get that. I get their pain. But for something to be actually transformative, it just simply has to be more than that. I mean, didn't Hassan Piker for the New York Times joke about like, we need to socialize Ozempic? I mean, this is the new man that communism imagined. Please.  But I just don't think they're good enough. I don't think they have – I don't think the left – I mean, the right has its own problems with intellectuals. But I don't think the left has an intellectual who is imagining something different, another world. So it's really about the sort of failure to critique the division of labor in your mind. Yeah. Okay.  I mean, even Mamdani, when he was asked point blank, he would say, do you support capitalism? He said no. Interesting. He said that on CNN. I think Bernie Sanders is the only other one who would say that. I don't even think Elizabeth Warren said that. I think she said she's a capitalist. Yes. But it's interesting because that is very interesting. But even if you say that it's like, okay, but, but your critique of capitalism is just sort of a bandaid over what we have right now. I guess that's what you're trying to say. I agree. It's, it's kind of, it's kind of terrible. Boris. Hi, Richard. Hey, just a little, um, anthropology based on personal observations, going back to the libertarians that we talked about sometime a little bit ago. I have never come across probably very predictably poor libertarians. People who describe themselves as such tend to be  either very wealthy, wealthy, or just generally reasonably comfortable materially. And most of the time, I've also not come across people of that persuasion who would impress me intellectually very much. And kind of the common thread that I've kind of generally seen is the kind of I've got mine mentality, basically. Either people who've already become wealthy and just want the monkey off their back and make sure that no one tries to steal what they've made or people who are um aspiring to become wealthy and are believing that the government is the one that's holding them back by taking a portion of what they earn um in taxes and giving it to undeserving people but the moment you try to press them on okay how do you see the kind of societal um  structure and how do you see vital functions of a society paid for. Basically, you run into just ridiculously primitive and unsophisticated, not very well thought through theory and uh you know you it's so transparent basically i i couldn't care less i will be able to insulate myself from the negative consequences of whatever it is that happens if um if those functions aren't aren't fulfilled or sufficiently funded or if there if there are people who you know uh fall um to the bottom and um  will become violent or become otherwise a nuisance. And I will be able to kind of insulate myself from that. And by the way, if you just remove that safety net, if you remove the ability of people to somehow survive without contributing sufficiently  it'll create enough of an incentive for them to become productive. So everyone will become productive. They absolutely, most of them refuse to see any other factors that may be playing a role in, you know, why certain groups or certain types of people aren't productive or are, you know, posing a problem.  becoming nuisance or becoming a threat in everyday life and so forth. Also, needless to say, this mentality works very well. I should say, I guess, the disproportionate share of people who, in my experience, who have described themselves as libertarian are Jewish as well, because they tend to have that sort of  kind of outlook in life and, you know, get off my back. Um,  So I guess that's all I wanted to say. Well, Jews are overrepresented in all fields. That's true. You would feel the same way if you went to a Marxist gathering. Or a right-wing gathering, for that matter. That is true. I want to throw this out. I was just thinking about this. Yeah. Do you think that the fact that Mumdami is a Muslim is sort of getting at what I'm talking about, like that lack of utopia and so on? Because you can't separate the Soviet tradition from Hegelianism from the new atheism, so to speak, of Bruno Bauer, that Marx himself was reacting against, interestingly, in the young Marx period, on the Jewish questions, an excellent example of this. But I guess what I'm saying is that there's no real critique of society, even on this profoundly deep level of religion.  Because Mumdami also, I'm sure he hates Israel. And Mumdami, when he goes back to his apartment with his wife, he really hates Israel. And he sort of lets some of that show in public comments. But... He'll also do promotional videos where he's talking about Yom Kippur and the Day of Atonement and I guess Rosh Hashanah, the sweetness for the new year. He's also sort of loves these communities on some level. And he thinks that the real good Jewish communities  will express the just benign nature of their religion, which must be there. It has a golden heart. After all, my religion, Islam, is based on theirs. And the fact that he's not willing to criticize society on the deepest levels, and the most profound levels, but also the most offensive levels, is why he can't imagine a new society, why he's kind of like an impotent Marxist at the end of the day. Because Marx... was react in in on the jewish question which is a brilliant essay and it's very important might even have symbolic resonances we should revisit this but marx is in a way defending the com the jewish communities now that it's usually not how it's taken but he does not he wants to emancipate all humankind and that includes the jews but  He doesn't disagree with someone like Bruno Bauer on the ultimate outcome. Like the Jews, he was a post Jew himself and they will be post Jews too. And I don't think he ever could imagine like a backward ghetto or a Jewish community ultimately existing in communism.  we are moving forward in a way that we're going to wipe the slate clean of that baggage. Now it's more complicated than that. Maybe that's more what Bruno Bauer would say, but that's ultimately the Soviet communistic impulse is to do something like that. Mumdami wants to cling to, to his religion much like obama talked about conservatives clinging to their guns and their bibles he wants to cling to religion itself he wants to cling to judaism he wants to he does i don't believe the man that made those promotional videos i don't think he's entirely lying i don't think he actually wants to destroy those communities i think he imagines them as these cute little you know little deposit deposits of you know benign abrahamism he certainly doesn't want to wipe the slate clean of muslims he is one he doesn't want to wipe the slate clean of christians he might dislike the vangis support israel but he thinks that there's some benign essence to christianity and so on But because he's not willing to engage in critique of society at its deepest and most offensive levels is why he can't really change anything. And at the end of the day, all we're talking about is the creation of some just shitty state-run bodega. You know?  He's not good enough because he's too nice. This is my critique of him. Artyom? Hi, Richard. How are you doing today? Doing well.  Awesome. I was going to bring up this movie that's in the movie theaters right now by Paul Thomas Anderson, because it is about revolutionaries, like far left revolutionaries. I have not seen it. One battle after another. Yeah, it's great. People say like New York Times, Washington Post, they say it's the movie of the year. It's going to win all the awards, but I'm not going to spoil it. I'm just going to say that the dynamic it...  Shows is basically how they were neutralized. All these revolutionaries in 2025, they're just gone. And DiCaprio plays this washed up kind of like just a drug addict, a loser guy who previously was a revolutionary. But now he just, all he does is just smoke weed, watches TV, just... like and you brought that idea up remember of neutralizing the left radical left-wing radicals like actual evolutionaries and now they're just you know they're just smoking weed it's like the big lombowski but not funny i guess i mean it's like the dude is a comical presentation of of the character in one battle after another basically  Yeah, it's a great movie. I hope you'll see it. I will definitely go see it. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, I do need to see it. I've sort of been kind of busy in taking care of kids. It's kind of a three-hour investment as well, but I do want to see it in theaters. It's playing, and I think I will have complicated feelings about its depiction of a washed-up leftist. I listened to Frank Kermode's review, and I definitely got... the um the the sentiment from him that that you are offering as well so yeah i mean i kind of hate the left in a way but i i i don't know i i sort of like want them to be better just because it's a good adversary like i want them to actually have ideas that  are worth engaging with and that are serious. A regular guy. Yeah. Um, in regards to them, imagining a new economic system, I've harped on this before, but there was Cambodia under Pol Pot did abolish money and it was the most brutal regime ever. And they haven't really thought this through where, okay, um,  Everyone wants to be a celebrity or an aristocrat even if they don't think in those terms. Like nobody – very, very few people want to work. When you get to it, there's a reason they pay you to work, not you pay them to work. Now, some jobs are harder than others and it's almost never in proportion to how you're paid. I've had jobs where I did basically nothing and I got paid more than jobs where I worked the hardest in my life. But – and they're not willing to confront the fact that who is ultimately going to be the mud still of the world beyond capitalism. As much as they will disavow tankyism or they'll participate in the subreddit where they'll laugh at deranged tankies takes from the left as a social democrat, they have – or, well, maybe not social democrat, maybe more of the non-authoritarian, but still revolutionary left. They're not, they don't want to come, they haven't thought the world beyond capitalism through, and how do they get labor out of people, and how does stuff get done? Because everyone wants to be Hassan Piker, but a society that has, where everyone is employed as Hassan Piker, won't function, but a society where everyone farms can function, though it will be horrendous and most people would put a bullet in their head over choosing to live in that society. Well, maybe it's not that bad, but I understand. Maybe life under Pol Pot. Yeah, yes, I couldn't put it better. It's just bizarre that the icon of the left is this lazy layabout.  I mean, what does... What does someone like Vouch even want? You know? Like, what is an ideal society for him? I ask that seriously. I mean, because he seems to get... most um exercised by these issues that are just like ultimately bourgeois like detrius you know like the freedom you know pleasure is a right basically to quote welbeck it's like  Your ability to be gay but also have sex with dogs. I mean, I don't know if I'm even exaggerating. What is it that they want? What sort of society do they actually want to live in? Yeah, AA, do you want to jump in before I play a little bit of this? Yeah, I was just going to say a lot of them talk about market socialism.  As their ideal society. And how would they define that? I mean, it's usually social ownership, the means of production plus market and market economy. Interesting. So it's basically worker owned co-ops, but you also care about, you know, supply and demand signals and that sort of thing. So as opposed to economic planning by an authoritarian government right which is what the communist the Soviet Union pursued yes right so it's more instead of CEOs and shareholders deciding what happens to the company it's the or a board of directors or whatever it's the and ultimately owning the company and  treating the workers as, you know, their slaves. Instead, the workers own everything and they sort of democratically decide. I think Richard Wolff talked about this. Yeah, I've heard him talk about it. Aren't you sort of trapped in a company? I mean, isn't there... isn't there something to be said of the notion that you can change companies and move up in the world or something? Just the idea of the, the sort of stodginess of like, I own this grocery store. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. I mean, he described democracy in the workplace, but right. That's how, you know, it's basically his argument was, well, if you have, um, democracy politically which really only affects people you know when they vote so it's a very limited like how often do you involve your you know how often do you come up against the government whereas you go to work every day right and it's literally your livelihood like shouldn't democracy if we value that be in the workplace even more so than in in the ballot box but obviously in both places that was a sort of argument  Which is fair enough. Yeah. Boris, do you want to jump in? Yeah. Just reacting to this idea of worker-owned businesses. I mean, it falls apart the moment you start kind of getting down to the level of nitty-gritty details. So if you do not... If you permit... those workers to change companies or to swap their shares or to sell their shares, in other words, to dispose of their ownership interests in their company, in a matter of maybe a decade or so, this will lead to the same exact capitalist system that that we have because the more entrepreneurial the more ruthless will accumulate those shares this has been seen in every market which you know was there to for state-owned or socialist communist and this is the history of post-communism wasn't it yeah there's this is the history of what they call voucher privatizations you know throughout eastern europe i mean 10 years, 15 years later, you end up with oligarchs, basically, or you end up with a very lopsided system that with far exaggerated excesses of capitalist ownership and all the negative stuff that comes with it. But if you don't allow that, if you just basically say, okay, here's your share in the company or in the whatever it is, the business that you work for, and that's it. You cannot swap it. You cannot get rid of it. It's yours. We'll figure out a way for you to get some economic benefit from it. Then it's... How is it different from basically indentured servitude and people not able to move, not able to do anything with it? So they won't even treat it as an incentive. They basically will treat it as a salary. And then what happens if, I mean, you cannot  force people to stay in those. I mean, it's kind of... How do you get in? Like, you're 18. Like, where do you begin, I guess? Yeah, exactly. And then, okay, let's say if you want to retire, what do you do? Do your children inherit those interests? Or what if they don't want to? What if they don't want to work in the... I mean, it kind of seems like it would be tied to the person... working for that business or something like that i mean it's just on so many levels it's not practical and i i mean it's either not practical or it goes leads back to the same conundrum that we yeah we're trying to escape so let's just listen a little bit to dauphin and piker i i haven't heard this yet so i'm i'm curious what this is going to be like I think conservatives have a really great way of designing a narrative that makes sense to as broad of an audience as possible. Everyone is in the business of crafting media narratives, right? I wish Democrats were a little bit better at it, to be fair.  Hassan Piker has no filter. Or at least that's the generous way to describe his marathon streaming broadcasts. Fascists need to go to prison permanently. Sig Heilig has one use. you're a nazi if donald trump is going somewhere it is certainly not heaven israel is an illegal entity okay which cover everything from the war in gaza it's crazy to me that we treat israel like this unstoppable force like they are not human beings that are making these decisions to bomb schools mosques hospitals to his fitness regimen  Are you on creatine? Yes, I love creatine. I love creatine. He's a self-proclaimed Marxist and anti-imperialist. We here in the United States of America live under the comfort of being a part of the labor aristocracy. Who's been hopefully called the left's answer to Joe Rogan and who's compared himself to Rush Limbaugh. And he keeps getting suspended from his platform, Twitch, for language that he calls hyperbolic and other people call incitement.  Is this person calling for the death of a U.S. senator? Of course not. Hello. If you're watching this, that means I just got banned. Is he the future of the left? Or is he just another example of how living on the Internet drives everyone insane? Hassan Piker, welcome to Interesting Times. We are living in some interesting times, considering that it is you, Ross Douthat, who is interviewing me for The New York Times. I feel like that's very interesting. Who else would it be, man? This is a show, this is a place for the interesting perspectives of our moment. And I think that's what you represent.  And we're going to get into that. We're going to talk about the Hassan Piker worldview. We're going to talk about debates about political violence. But I thought we should start because I know what you do. I'm very tech savvy, obviously. I'm very online. I understand the internet. But there may be some...  listeners and viewers who don't know what a Twitch streamer is. So I want you to tell me what a Twitch streamer is.  Yeah, Twitch streamers broadly, for the most part, play video games. I'm a little bit unique to the space because I cover politics. I do news and political commentary for the most part. I do lifestyle stuff as well, and I do the regular things that Twitch streamers do on the side, but that's secondary. um but twitch is basically a live streaming platform so for the boomers that read the new york times i would say it's like youtube but it's always live it's like just live stream youtube that's it right so when i make a podcast i come into this beautiful wonderful studio and i sit down and it's like a self-contained thing but then it's edited and cut up and you know turned turned into the product right  But when you sit down, you go for seven hours? If you ask my audience now, they'll say half day, half day Hossie, and they'll say seven hours, which is a joke. But yeah, I used to do it for eight to 10 hours every day, but I'm 34 now. Yeah. So I just, I lowered it to seven.  Okay. And you're doing it after we record this, right? Yeah. And I go seven days a week as well. Every Sunday. Every Sunday. Okay. Yeah. And I think if someone, you know, they can see you right now with the mic and the background, right? But if someone who wasn't familiar with this sort of dropped into the stream, they'd see other stuff on screen, right? Yeah. So what would they see? What do you share the screen with? um normally at any given moment if you tune in i don't know exactly how i figured this out maybe it's my adhd but uh i have been able to somehow offer commentary that people consider compelling right while simultaneously responding through and you're responding somebody writes a sentence is that uh i'm i'm basically like rush limbaugh but for zoomers so it's almost like am radio in the spirit of like conservative uh commentary but obviously I think I have a higher standard for the veracity of the information that I'm looking at, because a big part of what I do, I think, especially in this age on the Internet, is sift through the misinformation. So a big part of what I do is also just like going through all of that.  And in real time and also trying to instill some sense of media literacy in the audience. So I explain it as I'm holding your hand through the journey of reading the news. Do you take a bathroom break? I do. How many bathroom breaks do you take?  I don't know, but there are some people in the community that time my bathroom breaks. What about food? This is just boring. After I podcast, this is too much confession, but it's like I'm kind of exhausted in a way that is not the case if you sit down. I don't care about his lifestyle. I want to hear him. You're absolutely correct. Wait, what was the title? What was the title?  I think it was a progressive mind in a MAGA body or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So it depletes my social battery unlike anything else that I've ever done. After the end of like a 7, 8, 10 hour broadcast, I do oftentimes feel the need to just like kind of unwind and I have a hard time just like talking to people. I can imagine. In the immediate aftermath of that. But, you know, what so you mentioned you're 34 right so you're too old you're too old to go for nine or ten hours you have to go for seven hours um you don't have a family right you're not you're not married no um like are you gonna be doing this at 50 at my at my age of 45 the ancient the ancient years rouse doubt that is like 45 going on 70. anyway  He looks a lot older than 45. Um, but I, I sort of like Ross Douthat. I think he's fair. I don't care about any of these things. I want to hear him describe what he believes. Let's just scooch up here. Modest social democratic reforms. Okay. Here we go. Profoundly wealthy nations. The, the, what, what you're fighting for Hassan Piker worldview. What do you believe? okay here we go i believe that the united states of america is a profoundly wealthy nation it's the wealthiest nation on earth right now and therefore uh it could be doing right by all of the people that are in the united states of america and it and yet it refuses to do so and i want to uh through a system uh of of at first modest social democratic reforms basically claw back autonomy for the the everyday person and hopefully uh give them more of a voice in their workplace and also in the political process as well and slowly but surely yield more egalitarian outcomes  Yeah, it's interesting how he begins with resentment. It's not wrong, of course, but it's like, we're so wealthy here. Why is that? We should take some of that wealth. It begins with a standpoint of basically hating the broader society and people who are successful in it.  Which is understandable, maybe, on some level. We all succumb to jealousy, FOMO. But it's sort of getting to this point, like, what do you actually want? You want the world as it is right now, but it's just going to be more equally distributed? Like, the people who can't afford a Zempick can get a Zempick?  You know, creatine will be distributed. I mean, it's just a very, it's like just a sort of shitty, resentful socialism coming from this man.  The interesting part is he hates the most plebeians. He hates the Trump supporter, but then he wants them to be empowered in the political process. Why would you want that? Right. Like Billy Bob, who voted for Trump and who's racist, needs to have more of a say at the shop where he works. It's kind of like what he's going to ultimately create. right yeah um on the global dominance side i think that we should uh significantly uh scale back uh imperialism and and the endless wars that we engage in and focus on helping people in this country and even focus on helping people in other countries but in a meaningful way uh not in a way where we uh change their own internal governance structures aggressively and sometimes directly through intervention and by force yeah i i just profoundly hate him you know it's it's just all resentment  Basically, it's like the United States is too successful at home and abroad. There are too many rich people here. And then abroad, like, man, just stop that. Like, stop like invading countries and like spreading hegemony. Like, just be chill and give them cash. Like, okay. Is this guy a Turk? Is he Turkish? Yes, he's Turkish. He's related to jank or whatever the fuck it is.  I just, yeah, it's just like the resentment of second world people. It's just all it is. There's no theory. There's basically a sense of you rich, you give me. Which again, sort of understandable if I'm being overly fair here, but it's not a theory. And it's like, it's,  Just resentment. It's not transformative in any way, shape, or form. Truly transformative in a way that Marx would understand. He is the lumpenprol, but he's a rich lumpenprol. Okay, so situate that narrative relative to actual democratic politicians and activists and so on, right? Like, are you where Bernie Sanders is and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are? Or are you someone who's saying, that's a good start, but fundamentally, you know, we want to be democratic socialists, but with an emphasis on the socialism. Like, how far do you want to take the transformation of America?  Okay, so it's not just the transformation of America. I think it's the transformation of global politics in its entirety. I think that capitalism was an evolution away from feudalism and monarchies. And I think it was a fantastic evolution away from that structure. And liberal capitalist democracies, I think, for a very long time presented this wonderful new evolution. But I think it's time for an alternative vision uh to take place considering that the the tremendous amount of bloodshed that keeps propping up the system continues and i feel like we have an opportunity to to move away from this especially at a time when liberalism is demonstrably failing And we are seeing, even as Kaslanstein recognizes illiberals that are taking advantage of this situation. Now, of course, he would probably consider me to be illiberal in some respects as well. Well, we don't have to say illiberal. Let's say post-liberal, right? So you've got people on the right who would call themselves post-liberal. You've got religious post-liberals. You've got the  Curtis Yarvin, you know, we're going to have a Silicon Valley king, post-liberal, right? So you're a left post-liberal. I think that's fair. Yes, I wouldn't say I'm a liberal, yeah. Right, you're post, right? So you want something after. Liberalism was good for a while, but it's generated too many inequalities. It's too harsh on the world.  But what is the alternative? Is it Marxist? Is it, you know, is it essentially deeper and more profound government management of the economy? What are we talking about? I think I don't have the perfect solution for this. And this is something that I readily admit. But I think moving in the direction of socialism would be a wonderful start. And the reason why I say that is because, as you mentioned, like a lot of the post liberal conversations almost always revolve around unifying strength in the hands of one singular figure or one person going back to a neo feudalist or like a like a. aristocratic monarch structure that curtis yarvin advocates for what i'm advocating for is more democracy um principled democracy not even in the the anarchist sense where uh everything has to be handled with uh or all unjustifiable hierarch hierarchies must be abolished through uh direct participation but at least like having more democratic process and getting people more involved, uh, starting at the, the point of commodity production and then moving all the way to political participation. Um, I want to talk in a minute about sort of how you develop this worldview and, and your background, but I want to pause on that idea of sort of democratic change. Right. Um,  Is all-effective change democratic? Or, you know, the thing that the original post-liberal Marxists tended to believe, right, was that, you know, there are certain things you can accomplish through a democratic system, but there's also revolutionary moments, right? To be clear, this isn't just a Marxist idea, obviously. This is the United States of America. We're founded on a revolution, right? Yeah.  But what is your view of revolution as a potential transformative force in the world? All politics in my worldview revolves around the distribution of resources and the distribution of power. And a big part of that component is, of course, violence as well. Revolutionary violence, for example. And it just simply means like who gets to do the violence and who gets to be on the receiving end of that violence that we have normalized. Because the systems that we exist under are inherently violent. All political systems are. It's just more.  Um, did I lose him here? I'll try to do that again. Oh, he's back. Okay. A system that benefits as many people as possible, that has more, like I said, egalitarian outcomes. And the current system, as you said, uses violence. And yeah, all political systems are about the monopoly of force in the end. Right. But you use the phrase redirect violence. What does it mean to say we need to redirect violence?  I mean, first of all, I abhor violence. Let's just start there, right? But violence in this abstract concept would be equivalent to the structural violence of poverty, for example. So when I'm talking about violence, I want to make it very clear. I'm not talking like, go out, take up arms, and start shooting people, right? I'm talking about the structural violence of poverty, and redirecting that the same way would be-  The structural violence of equity. The structural eradication of unjust wealth. Would that be fair? So the socialist society does not go out and shoot people. Though this has happened in some socialist societies in the past. Of course.  I should just note. But it goes into you live in you live in L.A., right? So it goes into, you know, Beverly Hills or something. And it says today the you know, the city council has voted to expropriate expropriate your lavish, undeserved wealth and return your homes to the people. And that's backed up by police power. So it's violent.  But it's not shooting people against the wall. But is that what you mean? That kind of redirection? Yeah, a similar structure, I think, has been attempted or was exhibited in Cuba. And I think it was Fidel Castro himself who personally took back... any farmland from his own family members that that went above and beyond what the state had designed now obviously this is a terrifying concept for a lot of people so this is so far out in the future right yeah this is so far out in the future uh for for even someone like myself that like i don't even see the necessity of arguing on how this would work because i'm more invested in especially in the short term getting socialized medicine like getting universal health care uh getting free schooling uh all the way up to the college education especially for public universities ensuring that we have some semblance of of government competition if you want to call it that right interferes with the with the regular market to claw back housing prices for example by by creating public housing uh things that exist in other uh fairly robust social democracies and things that actually a lot poorer nations have been able to develop just good governance okay but we're having so we're having a debate right now about political political violence okay well this aggression will not stand ma'am  I mean, he just sort of ends up as a Cold War liberal. I mean, there's a lot of public housing in Scandinavia and Austria. I mean, but he doesn't have the courage of his conviction, so he just puts off the day of the rope, so to speak, when we're going to go into Beverly Hills and take their stuff. their luxury goods will be given to the rest of the, they're going to take back the Rolexes and the Rolls Royce. Yeah. I, yeah, it's not very serious. Well, um, my kids are demanding that I end this discussion, so I would like to go on, but I do hate him. And I do feel like we actually got a long ways. Um,  discussing this. So anyway, guys, great discussion, good discussion on the shutdown of capitalism. And I liked the baseball discussion. I hope you did too. At least Chris and I maybe solely enjoyed it. And then I think we also got into doing stuff together, meetups. So I'm going to put a bookmark in it there. But thank you all for being here. Sorry about that. I just don't have any help right now. But  Yes, Yankees suck. Yes, true. I don't have any help right now, so I'm going to have to go take care of the kids. But I will talk to you guys soon. And I think we're going to do something on Sunday after I send out the survey. So I will talk to you guys soon. All right. Ciao. Bye.

It was kind of – Columbus Day was actually a controversial holiday –  Because of the Italians? Yes, because it was sort of viewed... It was actually the Klan who originally opposed it. Interesting. Because now the Second Era Klan, because it was seen as a celebration of potpourri and all that. And I vaguely remember reading Leif Erikson Day was kind of considered an alternative to that. Interesting. I thought the notion... Was it...  what is I'm, I'm showing my ignorance here. Was it Eric, the red or leaf Erickson who might have discovered North America? I believe Eric – someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but Eric the Red discovered Greenland, I think. Okay. And so there's speculation that he might have traveled as far as North America because I remember it's like the lumber he used was – It's been confirmed that Eric the Red did go to Newfoundland and I think set up that colony. Interesting. Okay. So he was – it was kind of a permanent settlement – No, but it was, it was for, I think for fishing and the, the sort of memory of the, the land got kind of foggy after that. But yeah, they did settle like the tip of, um, of Newfoundland and they have a reconstructed settlement over there. Interesting. So it's less controversial than I imagined. Yeah. Um,  It is. Well, it's because, you know, Columbus did kill a lot of people. And I think Leif Erickson had his colony may have had like a few violent encounters with the natives, but it wasn't a permanent thing. Interesting. Well, the more you know.  Um, so let's see. I mentioned this very briefly. Um, a, uh, young man named Aiden, I've invited to join us and he just confirmed that he is going to be joining us. Um, and I've sent him the link link. I don't see him here. Aiden, if you're here, you can speak up. Otherwise we'll just begin talking and then I'm sure he'll just join us as we go. Uh, but.  If not, that's also fine. Some people get stage fright. Did he know I was going to be here? He didn't. Why? Does he hate you? I don't know. I don't know. I was trying to find him on Twitter. I know I've seen an Aiden account before, but like I said, I don't know if we follow each other. I don't recall.  Okay, interesting. Let me just get this started so we can talk about this because, I mean, this is sort of a tempest in a teacup in some ways, but I think it's actually important because it demonstrates sort of where we've come even over the past 10 years. So just to set it up,  Politico issued a report on the young Republicans in Kansas. And they were saying all sorts of red-pilled based and outrageous stuff like...  Hitler is my homeboy or something to that effect. And I can't wait until they all burn. And they were using various forms of the N-word with A is the ending letter, A-H or U-H. That's a new variety I was not aware of. But, you know, kids these days.  And basically, they were talking about basketball and your favorite sport of basketball. This this one probably cut deep, I would say, Adam, and they referred to it as monkey ball. Oh, I thought they said you said basketball Americans. I do take offense to that one.  But it was invented by an Anglo-Saxon Canadian, by the way. But anyway, it was sort of put out there. It reminded me a lot of the...  scandalizing long form essays that would come out back in 2016 and 17. They raided Milo's Discord server and they found out that his password was 1488 or something like that. They would just do this over and over and over again. All of these organizations have been doxed at one point or another. This seemed just to be the next one.  And I feel like it is different this time for a couple of different reasons. And so I'll stop sharing this. We can talk about the intrigue behind it, but I feel like it's different this time for a couple of different reasons. First off. This wasn't Patriot Front or Milo's Chat or, you know, Alt-Right Headquarters or something like that. These are a normies normie. These are basic...  Kansas Republican people. And what I found interesting is that they're using all of the language that I was familiar with with the alt-right. In fact, they seem to be almost 10 years behind on these things. All that stuff, that humor, the sort of, I like Hitler, am I joking, am I not kind of thing, that's all very tired, actually, in my opinion. If someone does that, I might roll my eyes. I'm more likely to roll my eyes than be shocked by it.  And it's trickled down in a way. And there's another element to it, which is that Richard Hanania wrote this article that he's very proud of, apparently. And he says in like 2,500 words, what could easily be said in 250 words. which is that there's a kind of based ritual among these Republicans where they'll be sitting down and one of them might mention, you know, like, Oh, uh,  It's too bad that ICE can't deport American citizens. Am I right? And they're like, oh, yeah, right. And, you know, World War Two, you know that. Wow. Maybe we took the wrong side on that one. Am I right, Mary? And she's like, oh, yeah, you're right. And it's a way it's a couple of things. First off, it's a way of like indicating esoteric knowledge.  And it's also a sort of challenge to who can be the most based. And you end up at some form of Hitlerian trad Catholicism and homophobia and whatever. And I've noticed this because I remember even talking with someone back in the day in 2017, and he said that he went to CPAC that year, or maybe it was 2016. And someone referenced a TRS meme. Maybe it was like, well, Dems are the real racist, or just something as sort of innocuous as that. And they... their eyes caught and they, they, they made eye contact and they knew that they were dealing with some, a fellow Gnostic, I guess, uh, of the based religion. And this is now something that's happening across the Republican party. It's not just a subculture and they try to,  They, I mean, you know, various media apparatus and law firms, etc. They tried to crush the alt-right. It's successful in many ways. But fundamentally, totally unsuccessful in the sense that all of this stuff is now a part of the Kansas young Republicans. And so it's a triumph in a way. I don't really...  I mean, it's a triumph of the alt-right. I've moved past all this stuff. I don't find it to be a triumph of some sort. But it is... Or a personal one. But it is important. And it's interesting that all of these people working in this apparatus are far more based, quote-unquote, than you can imagine. I remember Sam Francis had a quote where he said... With the left, that is the Democratic Party, the constituents are to the right of the leadership. So the constituents are kind of normal guys, maybe in a trade union or just some person out in the Midwest. They just want their pension and Social Security.  The far left of the party is way to the left. They're way out in front on cultural issues, on gay marriage, on trans, on all, you know, what have you. With the right, it's sort of the opposite, where...  The constituents are far to the right of the leadership. The leadership are deal makers. They're respectable. They read National Review. But the constituents are far more right wing than you would imagine. And I think that was true then. I think in some ways this is not anything new. And I think it's happening now. It's like... You know, you'll have a respectable person like Ben Shapiro, and then you'll have the person attending a Ben Shapiro meeting who's literally bearing a crucifix with him on wheels, but who's just being as outlandish as possible. And I think it's an interesting dynamic. But anyway, those are just some of my thoughts. What are what are your thoughts on this, Adam? feel like you know young guys college guys in a chat group like republican or not gamer or not you know wherever they're using this type of things they're trying to be edgy they're messing around they're being ironic i i'd say it is a bit of the on the zoomers it's the it's a fuentes effect a little bit that this has been a lot more normalized and uh I think it's interesting that they had this Jewish guy that was in the... Is that what happened? There was a Jewish guy in the chat group? This is the allegation. Yeah. And I can get to that if you want, if you don't want to say something beyond... Well, just explain it. It sounds like you know it better than I do.  Yeah, well, this is the claim by Aiden. And Aiden, if you are here, feel free to speak up. If not, that's fine. But so a friend of mine got blackmailed into leaking these chats, a total fucking coward and a useless piece of shit. So he's presumably referring to the friend. One of the people in here, he attended his wedding with me and still sold him over to the devil.  all over some useless YR beef. That's young Republicans. And then the GOP condemned them. Fuck these people. The GOP treated to fire my friend and vice chairman from his AG job because of TikToks I posted about immigration. I wasn't allowed to talk about replacement theory or any mainline immigration stances. They asked me to resign over Trump's green card diploma mill comments. I was blacklisted by Young Republicans National and blocked by the account because their leader is a BLM sympathizer. Okay, well, he's just going over and over and over again. So this is the first thing he posted. What he reveals later on is that the person who leaked the chat was named Bartles.  And he leaked them to someone named Gavin Wax. Gavin Wax is someone I've heard about quite a bit. And he is a major figure in the New York Young Republicans. The New York Young Republicans had this big shindig year after year, actually, post-COVID.  And I think the Red Scare Girls were at the last one, along with Steve Bannon, who shows up. And it was actually done up in a New York, NY Mag, I think, New York Magazine, a magazine like that. with, you know, glossy cover, sort of black and white photos of young Chad-looking people and hot girls, and they're all excited, and they're looking sort of demonic, like they're about to kill illegal immigrant children, you know, while drinking champagne, like...  you know, like Bateman-esque kind of stuff. And so it sort of terrified liberals, but then the Republicans also ate it up. They thought it was an amazing piece. So this is sort of a mover and shaker. And yeah, as someone mentioned in the chat, Gavin Wax is working with another extremely, extremely dubious figure who was a former...  Was he a professor? He got his PhD at Duke. What's his name? He ran a website called... Someone put his name in the chat. I'm forgetting at the moment. He ran a website that was called Recorder or Rejoinder or something like this. It was supposed to replace the Drudge Report. Can someone put it in the chat? I know. Darren Beattie, yes. Revolver. There it is. All right.  I'm so old, I get half of the word right. That's pretty good, right? Recorder was close. Recorder. I'll get none of the word right. Recorder would have been a better name, actually. I wonder if there is a recorder.  But Revolver News, and they did tons of stuff on J6. They did tons of stuff on COVID. They did tons of stuff on like the Democrats might have planted bombs at J6. And Kamala Harris knew that the bomb was planted there. And that's why she walked by it so lackadaisically. Ray Epps, right? They were the big Ray Epps.  Ray, exactly. They were the ones. They got the Ray Epps thing going. So basically, everyone was innocent. And there was this 65-year-old boomer who was whispering in everyone's ear.  And otherwise, nothing would have happened. It was totally peaceful. But then also, J6 was totally justified. We should have gone in, but Ray Epps made us, and he's guilty. But I guess ultimately right, but also an evil fed. And they basically demonized this man. They scapegoated Ray Epps as the problem. It was sort of brilliant in a kind of media strategy.  if totally mendacious. And it was also just preaching to the choir. It only had effect among conservatives, but anyway, Gavin, Darren Beatty's Jewish as well for whatever that's worth. Gavin, uh, a lot. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. Gavin. He's an interesting fellow. Uh,  He's a big Russia shill, too, right? I remember a bunch of tweets from him saying, pull out of NATO. NATO is the worst thing in the world. One of those art Kremlin talking points. Well, yeah, they also use Kremlin talking points in America. Like, J6 was a color revolution. J6.  done by the American embassy, much like Ukrainian, the Maidan was totally fake. J6 was a color revolution to install Biden's communistic gay rule or something. And there is also this sort of like anti-American quality to it, where even if I... might agree with him like 50%, even if there's more than a kernel of truth, but it's like the global American empire, gay, GAE. And this reminds me of another fellow from the alt-right days, which is... uh what was his name uh frame game uh who also basically talks about all these issues that everyone agrees with like censorship of populist or something this is like it's coming from nato nato's doing it all of this fits right into the cookie cutter of russian propaganda  Did you see Alex Jones and Tucker the other day? The show started off with 10 minutes of Russian propaganda. Interesting. A baby has a Russian wife as well. What are Russians? Just saying. Dasha and Anna and... Or Anya, I forgot which one. And Darren Beattie and his wife. And then Mike Benz. Alex... There's just a lot of Russian things. It must be a coincidence, but...  Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. RT was clipping it and posting it too. Interesting. Alex Jones is like, BlackRock and Larry Fink and the globalists are about to fall, so they're going to start a 30-year war with Russia to save Europe and kick over the whole chessboard.  I was like, oh, I didn't know BlackRock was on the rocks and going to fall. It's just so stupid. Tucker's like, we got to pull out of NATO. Zelensky's an unelected dictator. It's just like, come on. He constantly does that. I saw something, one clip of them today, where they're like, the problems of feminization.  This is what we need to be talking about. This is why we're at war in Ukraine, because women are more likely. This is actually something that I said back in the day. I got into trouble with it about Hillary Clinton. I was like, people think that a female ruler. is more likely to be peaceful but like actually women are really vindictive so watch out it was sort of a funny comment and i think is is sort of true but they've almost they didn't necessarily copy it for me but they picked up on the idea and they're like you know the reason why there's a nato proxy war in ukraine why we attacked russia was because of female leadership and  Yeah. So everything just sort of, every like right wing hot button, they just sort of shoehorn into this, get rid of NATO, et cetera. And it's pretty consistent. When Trump did his turn on Putin and started playing hardball with Putin, I saw the meme. I think Neymar Amalek made it actually. It was you as like the angel behind Trump with your arms on Trump. Oh yeah. That was good. I'm like Jesus. Yeah. I, I, that's the thing though, is that they were like trying to, you know, fear monger or not fear monger. They're, they're just doing their Kremlin talking points, but it's Trump doing all this. Their guy, Trump is the one that's talking about arming Zelensky and calling out Putin stuff.  That's the weird thing. There's this dynamic where Trump is a moderating force. Trump is also a more institutional force in the sense of a continuous force than they are. Guys. Somebody sing into themselves. Yeah. Let me just mute some people here. Okay. Okay. Yeah, he's a moderating force in the sense that Trump was the first person to send lethal aid to Ukraine, actually, in his first term. Trump doesn't like the idea of giving free money to Ukraine. That's true. You know, they're ripping us off. But what he wants to do is have Europeans buy American weapons and then give them to Ukraine. That seems to be his paradigm. He seems to be... pushing away from the uh uh tomahawk situation but anyway we're going way far afield i did want to talk about this this issue with the chat um so i i i don't know what to say i mean i i if if aden's here i'm i'm very interested in talking with him but  I think there's something really perfect about what happened in the sense that supposedly this whole thing was over some beef between Bartles, I believe is his name and Gavin wax and Gavin went nuclear on his enemy and released all these chats and destroyed his situation there in Kansas, et cetera. But I wonder if there's something sort of deeper with that because someone like Gavin wax is,  You know, I kind of see this a little bit like I see Charlie Kirk in a way. So Charlie Kirk is not like that teenage kid who is just who's trying to replace him, who's just this cut out conservative, you know, kid like, you know, we love Israel and free markets and Christianity or whatever. Charlie Kirk wasn't like that. Charlie Kirk understood that  Any sort of right-wing opposition can't really be opposed and it needs to be sort of absorbed. And so you could hear Tucker Carlson at TPUSA. You could hear Candace Owens, maybe not over the past year, but you could hear Candace Owens. You could hear Christ is King being shouted and chanted. You could hear vaccine conspiracies. You could hear pro-Russia stuff. Charlie Kirk was very pro-Russia.  So he sort of absorbs all those energies. Gavin is a sort of Charlie Kirk writ small in the sense that he's Jewish himself. What his motivations are, I couldn't say. But he wants to make the New York Republicans a kind of...  alt-right in the mainstream-like venue. Like, you're welcome here. I think Peter Brimelow attended one of these balls or galas kind of thing. So it's like, you're welcome here. We're hardcore. We're a little bit racist. We want to kick out the immigrants. Yeah. But it starts to go too far, and then you need to engage in some sort of crackdown. So you have an aura... You have legitimacy precisely because you tolerate racism and play footsie with it under the table and have fun with it. The second it starts metastasizing, the second it gets a little too hard is the moment you cut it off.  And that's at least my speculation of what happened. It might as well be catalyzed by some personal disagreement. But you also have a Jew who is taking out the Hitlerites. And it's just a little too easy, a little too perfect to be ignored.  Yeah, it's almost like I see what you're saying. It's like they took it a little too far. Yeah. Right. They chimped out a little too far. Now they're getting in trouble and now their careers are all over. And now they're going to be made an example of and disavowed. And the left is going to use it to try to bludgeon the right. So you're saying they should have been more strategic a little bit.  And that this type of behavior actually is counterproductive to win? Is winning counterproductive? I mean, I...  I think it raises a lot of questions about infiltration and so on. I mean, I think it's a little too easy just to say, hide your power level or something like that, because you can't always do that. And it also raises the issue that I've always mentioned with people who say, hide your power level. So when are you going to show this power level? When are you going to whip it out?  Because I want to know. Because I hear a lot of people, I've heard that throughout my whole career, beginning in 2009 or something like that, about, oh, I'm going to go work in the GOP and I'm going to hide my power level. And they're still hiding it.  Jack Posobiec told you that one? Exactly. Jack Posobiec, again, he made it... I'm sure everybody told you that. He made it very clear to me that he's a white nationalist neo-Nazi. And I'm not joking. I don't know if I... I think I mentioned this on one of your shows. He sent me these texts where he was referring to Harold Covington's novels about a violent revolution in the Pacific Northwest. And I was like...  what are you talking about? He mentioned something. I was like, what i was like just explain this to me please he was like oh have you read covington's northwest trilogy and i was like yeah no he had and i don't know if he i don't know what he was doing i don't know what he is doing he had a big game he was working on charlie kirk man that's who was turning charlie against israel was so big he turned charlie towards russia i think that's clear but very like yeah very likely But I guess just to restate what I was saying is that I heard this throughout my whole career of your power level. And it's like, when are you going to whip this sucker out? When does this happen? Because there's always an excuse to hide your power level. You could be hiding it for 50 years. And all you're doing is putting yourself in jeopardy of being fired if someone glimpses the power level, even if it has not been unsheathed. And you could just be fired immediately and all that investment is gone. But the other thing is that it's like this endless delay, like when is Jesus coming back or something like, you know, we're going to all keep our head down. And then one day it's just like mask off, you know, draws down, you know, it's like, whoo, like, I don't buy it. I think it's all a cope. actually did you see trump call out maria madelson as an israel firster that was high that was power level reveal that was how that was how to hide your power level because he donald trump said a terrible truth but he said it ironically comically and while while praising her and that's very powerful power level unveiled yeah i'm just joking i'm being a little sarcastic but that is kind of the thought the reason i thought of it is because i had that thought i'm like wait a second did he does he know what he's doing here yeah is she america first is real first i don't know i shouldn't say i shouldn't say maybe a little israel am i right guy yeah i asked him miriam what do you love more like he gave her the the litmus test the question  The dual loyalty trope in the Knesset. I did not have that on my bingo card. He's like, before I begin, I'm going to call some people out. Call them out, the Jews. I'm going to name them right here and now. Just name them. And he did it. And that is actually infinitely more powerful than just pushing papers in some sort of Republican organization for decades while you pretend not to be who you are. Jordan, do you want to jump in? Yeah, just really quick. I completely agree with what what your kind of theory was about kind of trying to eradicate the extremists here, because Gavin Wax wasn't just like some Republican operative. He aligned the NYRC with the ZOA. Apparently he's friends with Mort Klein, the ex CEO of the ZOA. And he also aligned the NYRC with the WJC. So if you look up Gavin Wax, ZOA on Google,  I have a note pulled up here. Gavin Wax, ZOA. This is from February 6th of 2020. It says the NYRC is happy, and this is with Wax as the head of it. It says the NYRC is happy to endorse the Zionist Organization of America coalition for the upcoming elections to the World Zionist Congress. So, like, he wasn't just, like, a random, like,  It's not like we're shitting on him just for being Jewish. He's tied in with the ZOA, the WJC. He has a role at the State Department. He was appointed to a role at the FCC in 2025. So it does seem like a little bit more than just a petty beef he had with some Gentile. It seems like it may have been...  We need to exercise the anti-Semites from our midst. And I think there is actually a lot of evidence behind that because he wasn't just some random operative. He is tied in with the ZOA and the WJC. That's all I really wanted to say. Yeah, that's excellent cooperation, basically, of what my theory was, which is that  It might be catalyzed by something personal, but there's an underlying strategy to it all. Even if he's not fully conscious of it, I think there's an underlying strategy. The other thing that I find fascinating and that should come as no surprise to listeners of this program or of Adam's program is there is this notion that Zionist Jews just have this allergy to the far right and they can't stand Christians and they fear them. They couldn't even infiltrate them if they wanted to or something like that.  I don't think anything can be further from the truth. Now, this isn't all Zionist. I imagine that what I just said holds true for a lot of liberal Zionist. They're much more comfortable with neocons or Democrats. I agree with that. The Likudites are much more comfortable with far right fascist wing nuts. And that's their coalition, actually, is like Ashkenazis on top of Mizorahim, to some degree, Russian emigres and other yahoos who vote Likud. That's their coalition within Israel. And then outside of Israel, who are the best friends of Netanyahu? Yeah, he has Democratic best friends. He has Republican best friends. Who are the best friends of Israel?  the dispensationalist evangelical Christians who are far right on everything. And I think now, now that that has been happening for decades, the John Hagee types is, of course, who I'm referring to. Now that that's happened for decades, I think people are aware of it and they're conscious of it and they have their own allergy to it. You know, those, those disbies, they're crazy. Vangies are nuts, blah, blah, blah. But they don't see what's happening right now, which is that the Likudites work with the alt-right, right?  And I'm using alt-right as just a sort of placeholder for this. The dissident right, the far right, whatever you want to call them. Darren Beatty has no problem working with Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones. He's a good guy. They might even, behind closed doors, they might even be like, he's one of the good ones.  You know, he's a good Jew. They might say that about them. I imagine they they do. In fact, Gavin Wax, if you're a far right racist who jokes about gassing people or throwing them to ovens, you're welcome here. Come on in.  Come on in. We might gas you at some point, but you're welcome to hang out for a couple of years. And they are intelligent. The person who made the far right sun wheel featuring commercial for Ron DeSantis campaign was Jewish.  This is not a weird thing, nor are these sort of like idiosyncratic, funny Jews. Like, you know, just because Jews are so diverse and kind of heady and weird, you're bound to find like a Jewish pagan or a Jewish Catholic or a Jewish Pharisee.  far-rightist or a Jewish Holocaust revisionist. You find those. It's not just about that. It's a dedicated strategy where they see the Nazis as useful to their purposes and is actually good coalition partners. And Gavin is just the best, Gavin Wax that is, the best expression of this. Gavin McGinnis.  Another one, punk rock, racist, potty-mouthed guy. You think the Jews fear him? Something like that? They don't. Richard, did you catch any of Gavin's interview with Nick that he did a few days ago? I caught a few clips. So...  Maybe this is just kind of me being out of the loop on on Gavin's arc over the last few years. But he like I knew he was always kind of a Zionist, but not to overuse the term, but he completely is like mask off now. He was talking about it was almost like he was doing a parody of like a pro Israel person. It was that it was that on the nose. He was hiding his power level.  He was overextending his power levels or something. But, I mean, he was just going off about, no, man, we need regime change in Iran. No, man, Israel's the best. Jews are the best. Like, it was really insane, man. He was going at a level that I didn't even know he was at. He's like the most loyal goyim at this point, man. Well, he always says that there are these liberal Jews who aren't really Jews, and they're the ones that you fear. But the based Orthodox, and he always does this little turn. It's very consistent. He actually doesn't have a lot of evolution or fluidity to his thought. He just says the same thing over and over. He's been saying this for years.  It's actually not new. Yeah. Jynos, Jews in name only. It's just nonsense. But the real hardcore Jews who are, you know, Orthodox or I guess Hasidic. He claims to have like an Hasidic friend or something. I don't even know what the hell he's talking about. Those are the good ones. They're based. They're racist. They're nationalistic. They love you. Very interesting. Yeah.  So just to be clear, this guy, Gavin Wax, is the leader of the New York Young Republicans? Correct. And this was a bunch of guys in a chat group that he wasn't in. Correct. But it's guys that are in his New York Young Republicans organization. Correct. And he either coerced the black bill. In the Young Republican, wider Young Republicans organization. Okay, not like in his crew.  No, he needed the chat logs leaked to him by this trad Catholic named Bartles.  who he extorted. And Bartles claimed that this man, you know, Gavin, he signed an affidavit, in fact, and he said that Gavin Wax and his friends were sending messages about my personal life to other people. It seems to be a euphemism for the fact that he's gay.  Oh, the guy's gay. He blackmailed him. Okay. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. I see this guy's Instagram. He's photoed on vacation with Matt Gaetz, and he's hanging out and partying with Roger Stone. Yeah. I've never heard of this guy, but he seems like he's a big-time young conservative. He's hanging out at the table with Trump and Steve Bannon and stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  He's shutting down this woke right mind virus in the Republican Party, it seems like. I think that's the angle. No jokes, no edgy gassing jokes on his watch. Well, he'll tolerate them for a little while until he gasses you. I think that's the lesson. They'll use you.  Up to a point. And they can dispense with you whenever they see fit. And on a whim, even. What were some of the worst things that were in there? Because I didn't really see anything that was all too that bad. It just seemed like, it really did seem like locker room. Yeah, it seemed like jokes and trolling and normal internet stuff. Yeah, that's what it was, basically. Mm-hmm.  The guy, the picture of the one dude, the big chud, the big fat one. None of these, the physiognomy on all these guys that got leaked that are talking like this. It's like, you'd think that they were anons hiding behind, you know, crusader icons and frog, frog avatars. I think it's just Kansas. Not to be too rude. Yeah.  There are a lot of people like that living in these communities. Just big, you know, like 300 pound guys. Corn fed in the chat, yeah. Yeah, corn fed giant heads. Yeah, Vance types, right? Vance chuds. Yes. Vance is like an idealized version of them, in fact. Yeah.  Speaking of Vance, let me... Children of the Corn. That was me. That was me as a kid. White hair. This is... Some, and it was disgusting about... So, okay, first off, this person right here is Blake Neff, who was actually in a... had his own chatroom controversy at one point while he was working for Tucker Carlson. You're making a little bit of news here yesterday on X, formerly known as Twitter, about this Politico story. But I think it ties in because we're talking about the celebratory nature of some, not many, maybe not most, but...  Some, and it was disgusting about Charlie's assassination. There is a story, and I believe the two stories are connected, that came out of Politico yesterday. Blake, explain this for our audience, for those who don't know. We don't need to wallow in it too much, but so Politico has a story where somehow they got their hands on something like 28,000 messages in some group chat of, I think, 12 people that nobody's ever heard of, but they decided to just publish... every single thing in this chat whatever they found that they thought was the most salacious and I think 10 years ago there would have been a very different response to it but people are starting to learn from this and the vice president is one of the reasons why so you tweeted this this is far worse than So what you did is instead of reacting to the story itself, you just posted what Jay Jones, our friend in Virginia, who's running for AG as the Democrat, had said where he wanted his political opponents to die. And then when someone thought he might be kidding, he called to make it clear. Actually, it wasn't a joke. I was serious. That's how people change their mind. And you just pointed out, quote, this is far worse than anything said in any college group chat. And the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia.  I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence. And we have 14 million views on that. Just a little viral, Mr. Vice President. Yeah, I mean, look, I'll let the tweet speak for itself. I'll say a couple of additional things. First of all, A person who is very politically powerful, who is about to become one of the most powerful law enforcement officers in the country, that person seriously wishing for political violence and political assassination is 1,000 times worse than what a bunch of young people, a bunch of kids, say in a group chat, however offensive it might be. That's just reality. And if you allow yourself to be distracted by this person's incredible endorsement,  Is it actually worse? Isn't supporting the ideology of Nazism sort of worse than vaguely fantasizing about your political opponents dying? Just saying. He's playing a whataboutism thing.  which is pretty typical, but I feel like it doesn't work like, you know, on his own terms. But let's listen to a little bit more. Disgusting endorsement of political assassination by focusing on what kids are saying in a group chat. Grow up. I'm sorry. Focus on the real issues. Don't focus on what kids say in group chats. But there's another angle to this that I just have to be honest about. I mean, I'm like an old guy at this point. I'm 41 years old. I have three kids. I grew up in a different world where most of the stupid things that I did when I was a teenager and a young adult, they're not on the internet. I'm going to tell my kids, especially my boys, don't put things on the internet. Be careful with what you post. If you put something in a group chat, assume that some scumbag is going to leak it in an effort to try to cause you harm or cause your family harm.  But the reality is that kids do stupid things, especially young boys. They tell edgy, offensive jokes like that's what kids do. And I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke, telling a very offensive stupid joke, is cause to ruin their lives. And at some point, we're all going to have to say enough of this BS. We're not going to allow the worst moment in a 21 year old's group chat to ruin a kid's life for the rest of time that's just not okay like look i endorse this but and i i've said many of these things as well which is that we've we've entered this new realm where the private is permanent is probably the best way of saying it so  Outrageous things you might have said to a classmate in the hallway are now permanent. They're digitally preserved in a way that they weren't previously. So I agree with that overall sentiment, and we're sort of in a new world.  At the same time, they're not kids, actually. These weren't high schoolers. These were actually people between the ages of 18 and 40, which is what young Republicans are. You're under 40, basically. So... jd vance has just aged out some of these people were in their 30s now even if you're in your 30s you're 31 or whatever you you are still kind of dumber than people of my advanced age but uh he he is calling them kids and young boys that that is a bit off and he's not really being truthful there um But I think it's sort of like this thing in AA, he just had his hand up, but we talked about this with Ann Coulter. And it's this whataboutism argument. And the problem with whataboutism is...  is that you are implicitly endorsing the argument and value system of your opponent. So if your opponent says, that chat room's bad, and you say, well, what about this guy who fantasized about political violence? What about that? You are implicitly acknowledging that that chat room is bad.  And so it's not just a kind of logically fallacious argument. It's deeper than that. You're giving into them. You're basically saying you guys are worse than us bad people. And so you are giving into it still. And let's just keep in mind One very important thing, like I, again, I probably agree with or endorse like 50% of what JD Vance just said. I think he's making some good points. He's definitely one of the more high IQ articulate Magatards there is. But at the same time, Gavin Wax is still working at the State Department and all of those people are fired. Yeah. So like congratulations, you sort of defended them in some way, but you defended them within the context that they're all doomed. So  I don't know. Am I doing it? It's like he's going to condemn that in the Republican Party, but he's just trying to use it, not let the left use it against him because the left is going to see see Maga's Nazis. See, we're right. Vindicated. They're all a bunch of secret Nazis and dog whistling everything.  And he's saying, and Jack Posobiec tweeted, and I thought this was, I resonated with this. He just showed the empty chair of Charlie, and it's like, you guys are literally killing us, so let's not burn down America and the Republican Party is over because they're secret Nazis or something. Yeah. Like, what's really worse? Yeah.  I kind of still think Nazism is worse. According to the left, if the left thinks that all of the Republicans... According to their own value system, but anyway... If they think the Republicans are all secret Nazis, then that would be worse, I guess, than some random one person doing an act of violence. Politically, like rhetorically, propaganda purposes, I could see that. Yeah. I have one more thing to say, but AA, you can jump in if you'd like. Yeah. Hey, Richard, can you hear me? Yes. Okay.  So I wanted to say a few things about this. I mean, the first is that what was mentioned before, sorry, I'm just walking. What was mentioned before was the sort of irony of these Nazis online people and the fact that they never really commit to their positions, which I think,  really belies the fact that they don't really believe in anything. They just want an online in-group because they're anti-social weirdos who can't get laid and don't have any prospects and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the other thing I want to say about this, and Vance sort of reminded me, I can't think of anything more sort of pot calling the kettle whack situation of, you know, Vance calling the left violent. I mean, right now, the Trump administration is literally going door to door doing Gestapo Nazi shit with, you know, ICE. Yeah. I think ICE is... Largely incompetent due to the fact that the new recruits that they have are probably all 3% or white militia, neo-Nazi skinhead people. I mean, if you just look at them, they're like falling all over the ground. They're all fat. There are a lot of recent immigrants there, according to one story I saw, actually, which is also interesting. So they're these like round, like Mexicans are like, I don't know, like subcontinent or Southeast Asia people. And they're like, some people see a contradiction with a recent immigrant joining ICE, but I don't. It's interesting. Yeah, and I've not, it's interesting also, like you mentioned that, I've not seen a single, like, they're all masked, obviously, but you can see their skin color. I've not seen a single one that's black. I've seen a few that could pass as Latino, but I haven't seen a single one that's black. That's interesting. But anyway, so that's one point. The other thing...  is Vance mentioned this as well, which is people shouldn't lose their livelihoods over jokes. Are you fucking kidding me? The Trump administration basically got Stephen Colbert canned. No question about it. That's what happened. Yeah. And they 100 percent. Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel. Yeah. Now, Colbert and Kimmel, they're funny if you're like drunk at night.  But they're not edgy, edgy people. But, you know, it's fine. Whatever. But I don't remember Democrats trying to get Greg Gutfeld or Dennis Miller or Adam Carolla fired. All of whom are pretend comedians who are not funny at all. Because in order to be funny...  you can't be a bigot. It doesn't work. You can't hate the people that you're making jokes about. Like the punchline can't be black people are dumb. Yeah, because I actually believe black people are dumb. That doesn't work. The reason that right wing comedy doesn't exist and is not funny is because they're using jokes to be racist.  It just doesn't work and it's not funny. Do you remember this Fox News thing called the half hour news hour from like 20 years ago?  So it was an attempt by Fox News to replicate the success of the Daily Show. And maybe even the Colbert report was going on. I think it might have even predated the Colbert report. When Stephen Colbert was genuinely funny, actually. When he mimicked Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and stuff like that. Oh, yeah.  But I remember watching it one time, and they had like a Richard Dawkins-like character. And he was there, and his book was called The God Hoax.  And he was just making like stock atheist arguments. And then like the, the lights went out and there were like big booming voices and like there were lightning strikes or things like that. And he was like, no, no, no, the God hoax. It's misunderstood. You know, I believe in God. I love God. And so is the joke was as if God were like striking down Richard Dawkins. But again, the, not a joke because everyone watching that wants that to happen you know like that's they that's how they feel about adam green or something is that a lightning bolt will kill him one day so he'll shut his mouth and stop you know get get jesus's name out of your mouth adam  Yeah, I mean, I mean, so it's not ironic is the problem. You can a white person can make fun of white people. That's actually funny. Yes. I mean, Louis CK, I remember he was on Conan and he may he was talking about Schindler's List. And there's a scene in Schindler's List where there's this young girl who's screaming, you know, bye bye Jews or something like that. And he was making the joke that somewhere in a digital archive, there are audition tapes of 50 10-year-old girls streaming...  Goodbye, Jews. Goodbye, blah, blah, blah. And he sort of acted it out. It was very hilarious. Yes. It can find it on YouTube. But I mean, Louis C.K. is a, you know, Jew himself. But any sort of liberal comedian could make that joke because they don't actually want to see Jews go bye bye. Right. Right. oh i saw these okay i generally don't find adam freeland very funny i saw this clip that was hilarious where it was an actor who was actually in a serious man and he said oh i you know he's like i don't really want to do jewish movies anymore and adam freeland said but there you should do a movie about the first man who died in the holocaust and and And this actor was saying that he was in line waiting for the train and he was complaining about how it wasn't there. He was like, oh, this is 10 minutes late. I've got things to do. And the joke was that the other Jews threw him on the train first.  Right. So very edgy. And, you know, I couldn't, I don't know, like if one of us told that joke, people would probably look at it as scant. But when Jews tell the joke, it's hilarious because obviously they don't want the Holocaust to occur, as you said. Right. Yeah. Right. And I mean, Louis C.K., I mean, just to make it even more provocative, I mean, he says the N-word on stage all the time. Mm-hmm. And he's not black.  But he doesn't actually hate black people. Right. He's hiding his power level, dude. I think he does. Maybe. Yes. I remember there was a HBO thing. I think you can watch them free on YouTube. It was Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K., Ricky Gervais, and Chris Rock. That was the other one.  And they were all talking and making jokes with each other. And one of the clips that went viral was CK and Chris Rock, they use the N word on stage. The other two comedians don't. And they were sort of making this joke back and forth. And Chris Rock, the only black guy there, is laughing hilariously. And Seinfeld, who's like the most sort of middle of the road comedian. I mean, I don't know.  how you can be ever offended by what Seinfeld, his jokes. I remember in the woke era, somebody wrote an open letter to Seinfeld because they were offended. I don't know how you can be offended by Seinfeld. But it was funny because nobody in that room is racist. They don't actually hate black people, unlike Republicans who actually do hate black people.  And unlike Republicans in that chat who are kind of Nazis, if we're going to be honest. Yes.  Like the liberals are correct. I'm not saying that they are going to launch the Fourth Reich or march in uniform or about to take over the Weimar Republic, but they are sort of Nazis and that's why people are offended by it. And so this sort of thing of like, oh, these people aren't Nazis. It was just a joke. Well,  Yeah, they are kind of just a joke. I'll give you that. But okay, you disagree, Adam? Yeah, I don't agree. Didn't you say there was like 28,000 messages and one of them said somebody liked Hitler?  A lot of them were making these jokes. I don't think any of those guys know anything really about Nazis. They just think it's counterculture and taboo and edgy and doing it as internet meme jokes. I'm not saying they're neo-Nazis that you might meet at a heavy metal concert, nor am I saying that they are a true continuation of the Third Reich. What I'm saying is they are all genuinely racist.  And they don't like black people. They, I don't know how many Jews they've met in their lives in Kansas. They probably met some in Washington if they've ever been there or the New York club, but there, I mean, let's just be honest. It's not, it's not like they were telling jokes about Pokemon characters or comic books. They were telling jokes about the far right.  Yeah. I mean, they're cowards. They don't believe anything that they're saying. They're just saying it because, again, they want to be in the in-group. But they do have bigotry in their heart.  So a lot of people are like defending them. They're not defending it, but they're saying, okay, left, like you're not going to make this such a big deal, right? That's more so what it is. They're condemning it, but saying, okay, it's not that big of a deal to the left. Like, so they don't take a political hit. I wonder if all of these individuals are going to come out and like start apologizing though. I'm sure they probably will. They'll be like, I don't think that I condemn this. They'll have their apology tours. I imagine.  I imagine that some of them will come out. I don't know. Aiden is actually here. I saw him pop up there for a moment. Aiden, you're better late than never. Would you like to speak on this? i shared a link to shapiro scolding matt walsh over his failure to condemn this chat group can you hear me yes we can um yeah so i just i just don't agree that they're nazis i mean like you've been in political movements and organization attempts before it's like  If you're watching football, you don't make a joke about the Roman Empire or whatever. You don't make an off-color joke. So the nature of them making jokes about the far right or whatever you would call it, they're making these jokes because it's relevant to the organizing purpose for them. Most of these people are – I know many of them personally, and they go to church. They're religious. They have families. They have kids in some cases.  Like I, I was at one of their weddings. Um, they're like, there are good earnest people and yeah, they make edgy jokes, but it's like, for like Alex, for example, Alex has never been rude to people in any of the instances I've, I've been with him in public and he, at, at, at Alex's wedding, half the, half the people at his wedding were not white. Granted, they were his wife's friends, but he wasn't like, oh, I'm such an avowed, hateful Nazi or whatever that I don't want. The people at the wedding were just nice, wholesome people, and there were tons of moderate Republicans that were there for him. Why didn't they make jokes about Stalin?  Because it's not the subject matter. Like, we're not there to organize for left-wing causes. But, you know, we still make jokes about, like, the gulag, right? Or saying that, what's that line that Stalin would say that they're... what was like the Leninist line or it was some communist where they described Jews as like rootless cosmopolitans or whatever, or, or there's the line of, um, being a useful idiot or a compromise. Like there are plenty of, you know, Russian or rather Soviet union era jokes that people make in reference to politics. And I mean, people make jokes about, um,  I'm sure that there were jokes about being vaxxed or something to do with trannies. I'm sure there were plenty of leftist subject matter tweets in there, but you're not going to see it because there's 28,000 messages. I get that, Aiden, but I've been in these circles as well. And if you have dedicated your life to the conservative cause or the Republican Party, there's something driving you. You're not really just doing it for the money and you're most all of them aren't going to make a whole heck of a lot of money.  Right. And I agree with that. So there's something inside them that's driving them. And I think for a lot of these people, I don't know how many people I've met at CPAC in 2007, even. We're going way back before the alt-right emerged, before there were TRS podcasts and  the first Trump admin before all this stuff before Trump and they were far right people. And after a drink or once they felt comfortable, I've heard like, I don't know what to say, like Nazi jokes or Holocaust revisionism or far right discussion of women, etc. Like you scratch them, you scratch a conservative and a fascist bleeds.  Well, I think that there's definitely some truth to that. I'm not making the contention that they don't have radical right wing beliefs or that they're not in this. They're definitely not moderate Republicans by any stretch of the imagination. That's not my contention. My contention is that they are not in a literal, true sense.  National, you know, socialists. And I'm sure you don't mean that literally either. No, I think we would both. I mean it loosely. Yeah. Yeah. I think we'd both agree that national socialism has has no meaning at this point. I mean, they say people like Iron Gaines is like black Hitler. So so it's more of like a loose loose term now. But at the same time, I don't think that they're Nazis in the colloquial sense of they have these... The term Nazi is used to describe someone with hateful, violent, militant, egregious beliefs. I get it. But okay, hold on. All you're doing is arguing that these people are, in fact, mainstream Republicans and kind of boring people.  Well, I would actually say that in a lot of ways, they are boring. They just have... They have a... different set of beliefs from, say, someone like Mitch McConnell, obviously, like they'd probably share immigration restrictionism, have a very, you know, extreme social beliefs. But I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that it's hateful. And that's what this whole thing is about, is it's to say that these people wish death upon others. They want them harmed. They want to see these people suffer or whatever.  But in reality, I can't wait until they all burn. I mean, that was one of the comments. Well, sure. And I'm not to say that. What is the context of that? Like, who is they? What are we talking about?  Yeah, I mean, exactly. What is the context? I haven't read through all of the messages. And for the record, like I've asked some of them about the contents of it. And they've even said that, you know, not all of the messages are taken in the correct context. I mean, does...  Maybe you would say it is on brand for someone that's a Nazi to say sex is gay. Maybe that would be something that you contend, given the proclivities of some of the people in the actual neo-Nazi movement in America. But my contention, to put it briefly, is they're slandering them as hateful, militant, Sort of like they're using this as a derogatory term to express that these people can't be trusted with political power and that they're violent and hateful. But blowing off steam, which is something like, you know, saying you want your enemies to burn in hell. There's definitely like there's definitely a lot of animus and hatred towards that. And rightfully so. I mean, these people do want us dead. But I don't think it's I don't think a lot of that is genuine. And I think it's.  irritation, agitation, annoyance. I think that they have more like Paul B or Pat Buchanan sort of beliefs. And  Yeah. I mean, a lot of them, them are, a lot of these people are boring. Like I've heard people that have genuinely like extreme beliefs and they've never, they've never offered those up to me when I've, when I've spoken to them. Okay. Let me talk about Gavin wax a little bit. So yeah, Does the claim that Gavin Wax delivered these messages to the Politico, does that claim originate with you? No, I heard it from the people close to the story. And I read into... But if you want to understand... You're the first one that went public with it, though.  Right. Well, I had prior knowledge of this because I'm close friends with a lot of these. So the claim does originate with you? Yeah, it does come from that. Well, if you're saying like the popularity of it, I can't speak to that, like whether it's true or not. I took the claim based on what other people were telling me in the first place and what the affidavit said.  Okay. So depending on what you mean by originate, if you're saying that I'm the one that popularized it, I mean, my tweet was probably like the second most popular one in relation to it. Did the internet know that Gavin Wax was the name that leaked it until before you posted it? You're saying do they? The affidavit seems to suggest something like that.  Well, the affidavit says that Gavin Wax gave up the chat logs, if I'm not mistaken. And it says it in the article. And that's coming from Bartels. Yeah, Bartels. And that's the other thing about it is it says in the article he works in legal counsel for the SBA. So this is the argument that should be understood. Bartels is alleging that Gavin Wax threatened his job, and that's why he handed over these chat logs under false pretenses. He had the understanding that  If he was going to give up these chat logs, it was for something else. I was told perhaps it had something to do with an NDA. Maybe it had to do with other things. But either way, he was blackmailed. What he assumed were under different pretenses. He assumed that he was giving up these chat logs to prove something else and that Gavin wouldn't have permanent access to these messages or whatever. But if he's saying, you know, this is a lawyer, right, that's important to the story because that means a lawyer is alleging this person threatened my job if I did not give these messages over. But if you sign an affidavit and give it to a reporter to back up your statement, you're going to lose your job if you lie on the affidavit. So it doesn't make sense to be blackmailed and say, I was worried about my job, but then to lie in an affidavit that would cost you your job and probably much more anyways. So I'm inclined to believe that. Yeah. I just had a thought. Why is this guy? Okay, I get it. He's a Zionist. He works with ZOA and stuff. But why is he willing to hand the left a big W and make his own side look... racist and nazi just to like burn a couple guys shit posting in a private chat group like well and this is a story that was relayed to me i and again i i have like i've i've asked people around this info but i was told that there was some that there was like a jewish lawyer  that encouraged Gavin to go this direction. And I don't want to make the situation, I mean, I'm already defending people against the claims of Nazism. So I don't want to make this story out to be like unnecessarily inappropriate and to say that this is like a Jewish ZOA conspiracy or whatever. Because as I understand it, the whole matter relates to a photo with Trump that Gavin eventually got, like when you, when the rallies were taking place during the campaign season, if you wanted a photo with Trump, you always had to communicate with the advance team and let them know how many people were gonna be there and who those people were so that they can get through security, get these photos, right? Well, I was told that one event Gavin did not,  Gavin did not communicate whether he was going to be at this event. And because he didn't communicate that, he wasn't on the list. The person that was supposed to put him on the list, Peter, he said, like he told me privately and he said, oh, well,  I asked Gavin if he was coming and he didn't get back to me. Well, anyways, the rally goes on. Gavin still gets the photo anyways because he was good with the Trump team. And for what it's worth, like, I really liked Gavin. Like, I thought Gavin was – a good guy and he had always shown support to me and he was friendly to me he would like plenty of my tweets we had positive interactions i saw him at at the gala and and met with him like he he was always friendly and nice to me so it was hard for me to believe and i'm not coming out of this in you know a malicious way or anything if if there's proof to the contrary i would be the first to retract my statement and pursue the guy that's framing gavin because i don't have like a vendetta or an agenda with this i'm just trying to figure out you know who's who's attacking my friends and as as it was told me it had to do with this photo and then gavin lost the election for national committee man to the young republicans to peter So it was over a photo that he got and then a national committee spot, which, again, I don't understand the motivation for this. That doesn't sound like the juice is worth the squeeze to me. I was just told that he had a big issue with Peter. And I tried to meet with Gavin in D.C. a few weeks ago, and I asked Bartels in the story, um i asked him i said hey can you get a hold of gavin for me i'd like to meet with him and he told me and this was weeks ago he said oh me and gavin aren't like we're not on good terms right now like we're not at each other's throats but we're just not on good terms and i was like oh okay so i knew something was was going on for a while  But Alex was always good to him. Peter had always tried to be good to him up until whatever fracture event happened. But Alex was always good to him. Mike was always good, to my knowledge. I'm sure there's Gavin's side of this where, you know, it maybe justifies these actions more in his head to attack these people because...  because I'm only hearing one side of the story. But to keep it short, my understanding is that it was just why our drama and personal discrepancies and how things should be handled, because Gavin was supposedly, when they had the Young Republican election in August, Gavin was whipping votes to try and defeat Peter, who is running to oust Hayden Padgett, who's the current. He's like the guy that likes BLM, like he's super moderate. So it sounds really silly. And I totally agree. Like, we can't really understand the motive there. But at the same time, I feel like there's always the element to which the silliness and absurdity of it all can be a cover for the for the motivation.  Okay. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. I stand by my theory, actually. I think... That you think it's like a ZOA thing? I don't necessarily blame the ZOA. I blame Gavin Wax, but I said what I said. I mean, Gavin wants... Yeah, he's a nice guy. He's a cool... Yeah, it's what all these people are all good guys. Yeah. They're not good guys. They're all terrible people. And I think he was playing a sort of game of tolerating baseness in the chat and then dispensing with these people when he could. And maybe it's not necessarily like the proximate motivation, if that's the right term. No doubt there might have been like a personal fallout or something or rivalry.  But isn't it interesting that he did this? I mean, it is interesting. But when you say when you say tall, like Gavin was never in these chats like Gavin. Yeah, we know that you got a hold of them. Yeah.  Yeah. But, but the other thing that's worth considering is that this, this chat was used as like an Intel sharing group chat where, where they acquired Intel on other people in politics, like figuring out their motivations, anything that was going on with them behind the scenes. So this group chat has like more than just naughty photos. Like it has tons of, tons of Intel on other people. And yeah,  I think that can be possible motivation for Gavin to keep it. But as I stated earlier to other people, I was told that there's a Politico story that's going to come out and it's going to tie President Trump to Peter in some way. And the journalist obviously has motivation, but even more so, I think that the motivation is going to become... he went to Gavin wax and got all this information and now it's going to be part of a larger attempt to tie Trump to all of this. And so, well, I mean, I'm sorry, Aiden, but like, don't you think it's kind of easy to tie Trump to right wing wing nuts? Yeah.  Well, yeah. I mean, that's like most of MAGA. I mean, as people were saying in the chat, you can find these chats where people are saying based, red-pilled, and outrageous things all over the place. And the interesting dynamic of Trump is that he attracted these people. I don't think he uniquely attracted them. I think these people have been in the Republican Party forever, actually. Yeah.  But it's not like the liberals are totally wrong or that this is just some outrageous thing. I can't believe that there are Hitler lovers in the Republican Party. I mean, it's like, I don't know what to tell you. My question is, when you say, do you think that this is...  trying to think of how to word this. Do you think that this is, like when you're meeting this with kind of, you know, scorn, is it more the beliefs? I'm not scorning anyone. Because my interpretation of it, like when they call us Nazis, it's not so much to say that it's ideologically correct and more just to say, oh, we have beliefs.  that they don't like that justifies, you know, hurting us in some shape or form. It's just a derogatory way for them to, you know, justify it. You guys say the exact same thing about the left. Yeah, when they call you a Nazi, it's a permission to attack you or maybe even hurt you. But you also claim that the liberals want us dead.  And and so on. I'm going to play a thing from Nick Fuentes where he's also claiming that like there's this passive aggressive vicious cycle going on right now between the left and the right where they both think that the other side wants them dead. And that justifies doing harsh actions against the other side.  Well, this is so it's different. Also, like, aren't you a revolutionary? I mean, shouldn't they shouldn't they want you dead?  You can't go into politics and try to change things and not take some bullets. I agree with that. If you are going to just revive this country and destroy the left, are you terribly surprised that the left might hate it and hate you?  Well, I think that's similar to the Israel-Palestine question. Everyone always wants to pick sides in that debate based on who started the conflict, whether it was settlers or who was there first. And so that's the perspective we take. in in this particular issue is most of us especially myself all of us have wanted to you know do the debate and just have like prove each other wrong and you know be a country and you know maybe we disagree politically but we're all americans that's been our disposition from the start and don't get me wrong there are certainly like people that maybe that's not true but all of us like for the majority, most of us would prefer that we didn't have to be at, you know, diametric odds against half the country and have these beliefs. And if you, like, I'm not saying that the perspective is necessarily wrong from their perspective. I think it's objectively wrong in what the outcome would be. That being if these people who I would consider loosely as communists and sometimes literally as that,  Their perspective is these people are going to destroy the country. We want them destroyed first before they do it. If I was a communist, I would totally agree. I think objectively that's not true, and everyone thinks this, that their beliefs are the right ones, so it justifies their actions. But from my perspective, or at least a lot of people's on the right, we've always been the ones that have tried to have the discussion and sort things out. And then take, for example, Charlie Kirk. He was not giving into radicalization at all, and he was actively trying to fight it. But like many of us... On the right or the left...  What was that? On the right or the left? Well, he wasn't trying to give in to right-wing radicalization. Charlie Kirk was actively trying to put a roadblock on that in some ways because... I mean, he would speak out against this sort of stuff, but you could tell over time he was steadily, you know, approaching more and more radical views. And I think it's because over time, the situation became less and less redeemable. I mean, these are no longer liberals that want to have the discussion they want to put us in jail and that's why that's why i know but i i'm sorry and i i do want to move on from this but like are the ice agents having debates with the people they're meeting in los angeles like is that are you having debates with people that are getting sent to secot like it's it's like I'm sorry, but this myth that conservatives are these good, innocent lambs, and there are these communists out there that want to harm you, and so you're just forced to do something. I'm sorry, this is very self-serving. I mean, whether it's self-serving or not, it definitely is, but I wouldn't disagree with that noble myth at all. I would say 100% that many of us have felt as though we are pushed into a reactionary phase where we can no longer go from  let's just close the border and get out some of the illegals. Now we have to have entirely different conversations about the debate of what even is an American. And it's gone from, because of how far- What kind of American are you? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Listen, I'm going to end this. You guys want this. I mean, I'm sorry. Yeah.  You can't just blame other people for what you all want. I think the distinction is when you're speaking to your opponent and you say, I want your kids dead, that's not a joke. But when you're speaking amongst each other... They're not saying that. Jay Jones did say that, though.  He spoke to a Republican colleague and he doubled down on what he said. At least we would have the decency to say these are jokes. Obviously, we wouldn't have these beliefs and we say, no, it's just a joke. He doubled down on the seriousness of this nature and  These are just like meaningless YR people. That's an elected official. And you can obviously feel free to move on. But my perspective is just my issue is not that they see the game as a game of power and we don't or anything because we're coming around to that and we should. My contention is just that let's not misconstrue this as as like an actual policy position and put people through the mud for that, because we have actual policy positions that are, are freely out there for, you know, condemn, condemnation and, you know, debate like, like our immigration, let it, like the way we talk about immigration, that's something you can easily have a conversation about, but linking group chats and then trying to smear us as,  far worse than we are when we're talking amongst friends. When you talk amongst friends, it's loose. So I'll let it be right there unless you have anything else. Yeah.  I just wasn't terribly surprised to learn that there were Nazis in a young Republican group. I'll just put it that way. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some left-wing group chats that get leaked and they're saying all types of crazy, violent stuff against the right, too. I would hope so. Celebrate it openly. Yeah. yeah or a lap or a pro-lifer like i guarantee you you give a pro-life or a beer and then you say you know do you think we might have to kill the abortionist and they'll be like yeah like you don't do this if it's not a debating society politics is not a debating society if you're if you've entered the arena you've done it for some reason And that reason, there's a sort of like pre-rational, obscene urge that you have to enter politics. Otherwise, you wouldn't do it. And I think like obscuring this or pretending that it's like only the left is just, I don't know. It's not something I'm going to do because I don't really have a dog in this partisan fight.  Um, but okay, let's do this quickly. And then Adam, since you're here, this took up a little more time than I thought it would, but I do want to talk about the antichrist a little bit, but a regular guy, do you want to jump in real quick and ask? Yeah. So you're Kyle Kalinsky, you know, he reported on this and then I think a couple of videos later, he basically endorsed Marjorie Taylor's national divorce stuff, but in response to the gerrymandering stuff, um,  Kind of playing armchair psychologist with him basically over the years. He's kind of become more and more frustrated and more and more despaired. He just sort of threw up his hands after Trump won the second time, realizing it's not a hiccup. But it just seems like – well –  One, what do you think of the national divorce stuff? And two, it seems like this whole story is really bad news porn for liberals about how they lost young people. And this has been going on since 2010. Back in the day, there was like a brief bump in skinheadism when Obama got reelected. But who cared? They hang out under bridges. Yeah.  They live in trailers. They're just like the dregs of society. You know, most young people are liberal. The alt-right and then Tate and then Myron Gaines, separate movements. But they become more demoralized about how they lost the youth. And the right's not just old people who never went to college and are never going to know shit from shit.  But no, I get your point. I mean, first off, I mean, I'm kind of reiterating myself here a little bit. But like, first off, I don't think this is new. I think these right wingers have been within the conservative movement forever.  But yeah, it's true because it's like de-platforming works, guys. You know, let's de-platform him. Let's de-platform him. Let's get Trump off there. And then we'll just go back to the discourse circa 2012 or something. That didn't work. and you you know the alt-right is water under the bridge the 2016 alt-right is water under the bridge but like all of these people are basically 10 years late on their rhetoric about camps and burning people and hitler was fun well they were 10 years old 10 years ago these guys that's true that's true  I don't know what you were like when you were 20 years old. Maybe you were 10 years late. I may have been. I was always on the bleeding edge. okay you're you're a you're a special case yeah special scenario um antichrist thing are we ready to go to the antichrist thing did you see the south park and uh oh i can play that actually let me gin that up real quick i would ask people in who's raised their hand just uh be brief and concise ask a question  So I was wondering what you thought of Kalinsky and his acceptance of the national divorce. Yeah, he's embraced MTG's standpoint.  If America breaks up, it cannot fulfill its obligations around the world. And I don't think people fully recognize that. Like we're not just some, we're not Finland. We're not just some small country or Czechoslovakia would be a better example where we can just have a split and we're all okay with it. And so that national divorce is the end of America as we know it.  And he's willing to do it for free health care and, what, $15 minimum wage. Right. Which is kind of interesting. He's, like, proposed, like, keeping the coasts and just having, like, a little liberal enclave in Colorado or Chicago or something. Interesting. And he's kind of just, he's embraced the conservative, which was really kind of, like, not super far right, but just a kind of  basic tea party idea. Let's go to AA. I do want to move on, but do you have something to say? Yeah, I'll be quick. The whole discussion before, it was just kind of the black friend defense of, you know, we have black friends, therefore we're not racist, which is what every racist says. Um, I don't know. I mean, Richard, you said it best, you know, if you're Nazi, just own it, you know, just stop like always retreating whenever you have a, um, whenever you get caught saying stuff, you obviously believe or kind of believe or whatever. Um,  I don't know. I mean, fascists, they always do this. They just deny themselves agency. The Jew made me do this. The black made me do this. It's just pathetic. These people need to be politically destroyed and pushed into the gutter where they belong, in my view. Yeah. You're more anti-right. I just want to know what they said about Jesus in there. Were they saying Christ is king and  Because then they need to be destroyed. I think they're all from Kansas, so I would say there's a lot of C.I.K. What does Wax think about Jesus? That's the real question. That's what I want to know. They would have killed Jesus if they were alive back then. Oh, yeah. No question. You question my faith, bro? Yeah.  That's a reference to the South Park that just came out yesterday. Okay. Chad, do you want to go real quick? Yeah, a couple quick things. I was... AA picked up on what I was going to say, but... I mean... Just to speak to another aspect, like... When Aiden says, like, oh, they're not hateful. They're not hate... I mean, like, that's playing to, like... sort of like a I suppose like a very leftist and liberal sort of we are hate mindset we hate they're wrong and they're bad and we hate them at this point um like and and here and like like i'm not trying to say like do like just some oh everyone's so base now like that's not what i mean but like i mean um look like this gavin wax guy and um the others probably like the higher ups even in the state department like they don't really care that these people may or may not be hateful like if they were saying  hateful things about blacks or whatever, they wouldn't have cared at all. Their conception, when they say Nazi, they see this as a group of white men who are in a certain IQ range, higher IQ. They are obviously somewhat socially confident, and they have to be somewhat ambitious, and they're in the government.  These are, like, a potential threat to power. Like, you don't want these people in the power structure. So, like, that's why they're getting rid of them. And, like, this is happening on the left. Like, you see, like, a lot of, like, leftists, frankly, like, Letitia James. I think this is probably part of it. Also, there's a personal vendetta there with Trump. But... They don't want woke people in government and in positions of power anymore because they don't support the Zionist agenda, but they also don't want aspirational white men who don't support what academic agent calls the boomer truth regime, which is just like... You know, I mean, like now, I mean, like, which is, you know, every white man now pretty much under 40 would qualify as not supporting this. Like, you know, like you can make edgy jokes. It's not taboo to make World War II jokes or Jew jokes. You know, this Hitler guy wasn't so bad.  Yeah, he murdered some Jews, but was it 6 million? I'm not sure. Like, if you have these kind of beliefs, then, like, you're not the kind of white men that certain people want in power, like guys like Gavin Wack. So that's what he means. And so to Aiden, like, this group of friends, they're absolutely that type of man, type of person. So why not just own it? I mean, like AA said, like, I mean, I would love to see, like, people get called out and then just own it.  Instead of saying, oh, I have black friends. You know, I'm not hateful. I've never hated anyone ever. You know, and look, I think culture is kind of moving past that. You know, so anyway. Yeah. Can I reply to that? Yes. So I, I mean, I, I agree with all of that and we should own our beliefs, but we have to own the beliefs that we actually have and not the ones that are being portrayed to like, or being projected onto us. Like if we have racialist views or views about the way welfare is distributed or immigration, or whether we should be allowing nonwhite immigration or whatever,  even have legal H-1B programs or any of that. Those are things we can own, but the issue is when our beliefs are exaggerated in an effort to defame us, because when you exaggerate those beliefs, it makes it easier to fire us. I'm sure that those people... Don't like I'm sure that they don't really care about the Holocaust or any other genocide for that matter, because that's something that happens in history. I'm saying that the issue is to make it seem like we're it's to make it seem like we're genuinely a threat to these. not like a political threat to the power of structure of which we obviously would be, but an immediate threat to these people's lives to justify some sort of disproportionate response to us. And I do agree that, you know, there needs to be accountability in the sense of we have to own the fact that it's not just Jews or liberals making us take these beliefs, but there is an element to, at least in my case and for a lot of others, where We wanted to resolve things the American political liberal way or whatever, and talk things out. And eventually, the only way we've come to like a generative way of viewing politics, where we're not responding, but we're actually...  I don't know. Instead of being reactionary, we're being revolutionary. The only way we've gotten to that was by throwing off the liberal framework of working together and caring about hate speech. So in a way, they've pushed us to take accountability by...  I know, but this is still like, look what you made me do. And you're not going to ultimately accomplish these things if there isn't a positive agenda. Like, kicking out illegals... might very well be the right thing to do but don't you see that it's sort of like a negative almost sadistic like reaction to a problem that it's not really solving you know like You know, I remember all these conservatives like Putin never called me a racist or illegal immigrants didn't want to trans your children either. And you say illegal immigrants didn't publish books from the University of California Press or attend Cal Berkeley either. And so it's like America racist to what?  Putin did call America racist. Oh, Putin did in fact call you a racist, but yes. But putting that aside. Yeah. So when you say positive, you mean like in the creative sense, not like you make me feel good. You're saying like positive and the generative like creation sense. Yeah. Moving forward as opposed to reacting all the time.  I totally agree with that. Well, it was just like Sam Hyde. I mean, we talked about this three weeks ago, and I'm sorry we're spending like almost the two hours here, and Adam hasn't spoken enough, but it's like Sam Hyde is this nihilistic, in my humble opinion, extremely unfunny comedian. And Charlie Kirk dies. Charlie Kirk is...  Not terribly interesting, to be honest. Pretty goofy. He's a nice guy. Doesn't deserve to be shot. Of course, that's true. And Charlie Kirk dies and it's like, look what you made me do. We have a week to install fascism. Trump, you need to do this. See this? This is you. This is your family. This is your son. They want to kill every one of you. So the only response is that we kill them first. I mean...  None of that happened, first off. They missed their moment to install fascism. I think the Erica Kirk stuff is kind of cringe at this point, endlessly talking about Charlie Kirk. And you're not going to really do anything if it's just this reaction of like, we wanted to solve it. We wanted to be nice guys, but...  You are just too mean. And I hate to break the news to you, but maybe they should want to kill you. I mean, I don't know. Grow up. This is a fucking blood sport. It's like you want to engage in revolutionary change, but then you want the old liberal debating rules back where no one gets hurt.  Well, this is the last I'll say on this. I think you're totally correct in that we need to have a positive approach to how we're going to solve these issues. And we can't constantly be playing catch-up or own the libs. It can't be a framework where we're always trying to respond to the libs and just own them for the sake of it and do whatever the opposite of what they're saying is. And I... i i think my contention is not oh the the libs shouldn't want to destroy us or whatever in their in their power framework my issue is with other like republicans taking out people on their own side like that i feel like that's i agree i don't think i don't think this should i mean we all agree with that no one thinks that this should have been i'm not against what you're saying like i'm yeah  I'm not against the idea that the Libs want us dead. It's only important in as much as we have to... The only point in saying Libs want us dead, and I think this might be the misconception, is we're not saying that... to to justify or anything it's more of a way of waking up other republicans to say we're playing a blood sport and that's how the game has to be played it's not so much as you know complaining about it because from their perspective it's justified at least in their in their worldview but that's that's all i'll say on that because i don't want to take up more more of this uh show for that topic yeah  All right, Adam, let's do something that is in your ballywick, in your wheelhouse. I wanted to talk about the Antichrist, and I have an interesting article on Peter Thiel and his obsession with this. And I wanted to talk even more theologically about what the Antichrist is and the Katakon and so on, because these terms are sort of sketched out by Paul. And but before that, I'll just get the conversation started by playing this rather outrageous um oh here it is is that uh there it is this rather outrageous uh sketch from south park okay so first what is the antichrist the antichrist is a newer more human form of satan that will soon walk the earth we don't know how soon it will walk the earth but it could be within the next six to seven weeks  Okay. You see, Satan was a fallen angel, and God punished him. And to make sure Satan could never have offspring, the Lord God did shrink Satan's asshole to the size of a tiny little pinhole so nothing could ever penetrate and ejaculate inside of it. So Satan could never have a butt baby until along came Mr. Donald Trump, whose penis is so teeny, teeny, tiny it could actually fit in Satan's asshole. How small is Donald Trump's penis? Somewhere between six and seven centimeters. Six and seven centimeters!  Hey, look, this is very important, people, okay? The Antichrist is coming. The Bible refers to the eagle, which refers to America, the fourth sail broken, and hell coming to Earth. It's right here in Revelation 6... 6... 7...  First off, the 6-7 thing is very real. I have been hearing this from my own kids, actually. It's bizarre that they're so obsessed with this. That's a real thing. I was not aware that was a real thing. I knew 6 was scared of 7. yeah yeah why is six scared what is it it's from a rap song it's from seven eight nine right yeah um that's very old but i think it's like six foot seven so it's like six seven no it's it's from this tiktok rap song where the guy has six seven it's in there it's a lyric in a song  So it comes from an NBA player named LaMelo Ball. He originated it a few months ago, and he actually happens to be 6'7". And that inspired a rap song called 6'7", which it took on a life of its own. But it's not the 6'8", 7', 7'8", 9 thing. There's a lot of deep lore there, actually. Okay. You know what's interesting, though, Peter Thiel, I played that clip on my show earlier today, and I didn't know. I looked up Revelation 6-7, and it really is talking about the fourth seal that he says is America. It really is like an Antichrist type of verse.  Well, a couple of things here. So Peter Thiel has been giving some lectures in Silicon Valley. And these lectures were sold out, but they were actually quite exclusive. And you had to be on the invite list. Unfortunately, we weren't. And I've also heard sort of through the grapevine that a lot of people attended these hoping to pitch a...  project to Peter Thiel. So you have a lot of Silicon Valley nerds with maybe other motivations that are being lectured about the Antichrist. But this is something that clearly motivates Peter Thiel. And it motivates him in some funny ways. So he actually gave a lecture on this. He's done it all over the world. He gave a lecture on this in Austria, Germany. And the theologians there actually gave him an ungenugent grade on his lecture, which sort of means insufficient, failing, you didn't even meet the minimum bar. And I think that might have harmed him. He seems to have a very... curious understanding of these ideas, and they all are related to his projects in Silicon Valley. So he seems afraid of the notion that there is going to be regulation of ai or crypto or nanotechnology or biotech or whatever and that it is going to crush innovation and crush this ever forward moving uh of society of the United States where we just keep getting richer and keep getting more advanced. And he fears that this is all slowing down. He's even a bit of an AI skeptic. I, in his interview with Russ Douthat, he said something like it might add two or three points to GDP, but is it going to be a total revolution? No, but he doesn't say that as a kind of, you know, general technology skeptic. He says that as a disappointed technologist, right? And he might not want the human race to survive in the sense, not that he's a misanthrope, but in the sense that he wants us to become cyborgs, to transform ourselves. We've already become cyborgs of a sort with the smartphone, with...  artificial heart or artificial hip. Oh, we're going to take it further, a chip in our head. We're going to move past this. And what's unique about his conception is that that's something you would expect from a singularity advocate or AI advocate. But from Peter Thiel's perspective, this is orthodox Christianity. And he uses that word orthodox, that the problem with transgenderism is not that it goes too far in transforming the human body. It's that it doesn't go nearly far enough, that you're just chopping off your genitals or rearranging them. You're not transforming your very soul.  And this is what he wants. So he is married in a, I would say, unique way. He's very influential, so it might not be unique anymore. He's married the kind of weird sci-fi fantasies of singularity advocates with orthodox, his word, Christianity. And we are going to, much like you should, when you accept Christ, you're no longer that man you were before.  You know, it's not just an easy little trick to get into heaven. It's transformed you. And he analogizes, I guess, technological transformation with the transformation of the soul that one does through Christ. It's a remarkable confluence or conflation or confusion that  of these things, but it is uniquely Peter's. And he views the Antichrist as possibly being someone like Greta Thunberg who wants to slow down these things. So she's going to like, we don't want to jeopardize the earth with climate change. We don't AI. Ooh, we don't want to do that. That might jeopardize what it means to be human. And I find it fascinating that he pictures Greta Thunberg as the Antichrist. First off,  Might there be an immediate motivation here? Because Greta Thunberg is most famous for climate change, of course, but what is she famous for now? Opposing Israel, going on a flotility at Israel, reportedly being beaten by Israeli guards and then spit out the other end. So it's interesting that she is in opposition to Israel expanding, which is also part of the Revelation text. But also he views Greta Thunberg as a kind of fascist in her way.  You know, she's blonde. She's Nordic. She wants us to go back to the earth. She wants us to be sort of pagan, you know, if you will. And he views that as the Antichrist, which is fascinating. It's a fascinating figuration.  Of what that is. So that's what Peter Thiel is up to. So what do you think about all these things I just said? And what are some of your thoughts on the Antichrist in general or etc. ?  I don't believe there's ever going to be a supernatural antichrist. I think if anything, it's going to be somebody that is just trying to play out the script of an antichrist type of role. Right. I wonder if like, cause I've, I've played the clips many times on my show, Peter Thiel being asked about like, Hey, you're kind of setting up like an antichrist beast system. Like, what do you think about that? And he like, he, he,  you know, mumbles and stutters and doesn't really answer the question very well. And now it's like, I think Tim Dillon talked about, he's like, you know, you're this guy, Palantir, you're taking everybody's data, you're working with Israel, you got all these big tech companies, and then you're going to do all these series on the Antichrist. Like, it's like, does he want everybody to think he's the Antichrist?  Is he a sincere believer in Jesus and the Bible and he really fears an antichrist? What is his motivation here?  It's either one of those two, right? He wants everybody to think he's the Antichrist. He's leaning into this Antichrist archetypal role. Or he really is scared. Do we think Peter Thiel really believes in the Bible and Jesus? Or does he believe in like a Peter, Jordan Peterson type of Antichrist? I think it's interesting. And this is something I wanted to talk about a little bit more because...  If you're a real Christian, God is in control. You need the Antichrist. What? If you're a real Christian, you need the Antichrist. Exactly, to bring about the end times. So this notion that we as mere humans can prevent the Antichrist coming is the height of hubris. It is ironically, I guess, something the Antichrist would say. To go back into that, like we can prevent his coming and, you know, that the end times is some bad thing that we want to hold off. That's not really the Christian way. You should long for it in some way in the sense that everyone is going to be with God. And it might be terrible, in fact, what you're going to have to go through. But you are not in control of this.  And it's not just a bad policy decision that might occur. It is ordained. And so I think, I mean, that's probably why he received an insufficient from German theologians. It's like, you just don't get it, do you, fundamentally? Because Peter Thiel is caught in this... almost conservative mentality of like if we allow the liberals to regulate technology no one will be able to get rich anymore or he himself won't be able to get rich which might be his major concern and that's not christian yeah that's not christian in the in the like the orthodox view of an antichrist at all so what is he even doing why is so is he not a real believer and he's just trying to like  co-opt the Antichrist idea to get Christians on board to care about what he cares about? Is that the angle here?  that could be a very cynical angle that much like J.D. Vance, who thought Trump was the next Hitler, joined Trump by 2020 or thereabouts because, you know, we need to support the next Hitler, I guess. Or, you know, this is the only way to power. We can't do this on our own. We've got to hitch our wagon to Trumpism. And is this what Teal thinks? Like, You know, maybe I could work with the left, but no, that doesn't work and I don't really like them. So I'm going to hitch my wagon to religious fanatics in order to make sure that I can pursue AI biotech. Yeah. I think that's it, dude. That's the best explanation. I hadn't really thought about that before. You know, I've covered his interviews, but to try to get inside his head.  and understand what his true motivations are. Don't you think he believes it on some level? I mean, why would you... You could just... Wouldn't it just be easier to be like, as Christians, render unto Caesar, and as Christians, we believe in personal freedom and liberty. Isn't that sort of an easier sell than prevent the end times?  I don't know. It just seems like he must believe it because he otherwise wouldn't do this. Yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen his... I don't... He doesn't have a book about the Antichrist. I didn't... Nobody knows what he said in this presentation, right? Was there some leaks? Yeah, there's some reports on it. And I could read this report. To be honest, I summarized it, I think, quite well. That is what he is saying. Basically.  There's some other aspects of this. So the term Antichrist does not occur in the book of Revelation, even though you think it would. Terms like beast and so on are used.  This is a passage from Paul. So this is Paul's epistles. These preceded the Gospels in their composition. So they certainly preceded the book of Revelation, which was later than the Gospels.  So this is Thessalonians chapter two. Let no one deceive you in any way for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first. And the man of lawlessness, sometimes translated as man of sin is revealed. The son of perdition. who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called good, excuse me, every so-called God or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. I guess this brings us back to our mutual friend, Donnie Darkened, but Greta Thunberg is,  has never claimed to be God. And I imagine she's, I don't know this for certain, but I imagine she's a kind of agnostic pagan, but he's sort of probably friendly with Christians. I mean, I don't get the vibe from her that she's like a radical atheist. But as Donnie Darkin said, this man of sin, if you want to put that on one figure, I mean, does not Donald Trump just fit the bill? Man of rebellion. I'm not going to heaven, Richard. Let me tell you, I don't think I'm going to make it into heaven. Yes. Yes.  He's even said these things. Yeah. And I hate my enemies. I don't listen to Jesus. I hate my enemies. Right. Yeah, exactly. And just the man of sin throughout his life, just the amount of porn stars and floozies he's screwed. He hasn't had alcohol, which is fascinating. Yeah.  We associate alcohol Dionysus and Jesus. Maybe I won't go down that line. Couldn't handle it. Couldn't handle his booze. That's the real reason.  Yeah, but he's fascinating. He's clearly a man of sin. And so interestingly, the plan for Gaza is, you know, a two state solution one day, of course, and a ceasefire. But it's also that there's going to be an international community led by Donald Trump. The putting himself, I mean, Paul is a Jew, and the idea of, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. Doesn't this fit with Donald Trump, in effect, declaring himself God? King of the Jews in a way, or King of Israel at the very least, taking over Gaza, being close to that holy seat where Yahweh, the presence is, in fact, near the Temple Mount. I mean, doesn't this fit?  Much better than Greta. The original context of the Antichrist figure was Antiochus, who did desecrate the temple. So that's really what it's about. But it was obviously reinterpreted esoterically to be about a future person. But, I mean, I'm anti—if Christ just means christened in Greek and it means Moshiach, I'm anti-Jewish messiahs. Is everybody else—hey, all the based red-pilled Christians, are you not anti-Moshiach when Chabad Lubavitch says it? Right. When they say you're going to be a Noahide and bow down, otherwise it's off with your head if you don't bow down to Moshiach? Well, the Christian version of Moshiach Jesus is the exact same thing. Yes. Yes.  There's also this interesting thing. So this is the concept of the catacomb.  So this is also a term that comes from Paul. It also comes from Thessalonians. This is chapter two. And this is not defined, but this also reminds me of Alexander Dugan quite a bit as well. And Alexander Dugan is taking this from Schmidt. And you know what is restraining, right? him now so that he may be revealed in his time for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. That's Thessalonians chapter two, six through seven. So you have this lawless man, man of sin, and  And there is this katakon, which means the holding back or restraint. And Schmidt associated this with a couple of things, but he associated it with the Soviet Union or global communism. Basically, we are sinful ourselves and we're not perfect, but we're sort of  keeping back the day in which this awful thing will occur. And I think Peter Thiel seems to be picking this up in some level, like there's some awful future in which Greta Thunberg  our Thunberg forces us all to live like medieval or not medieval, like ancient pagans. And we'll be running around the maypole and maybe doing some sacrifices and, you know, lovemaking in the woods and like no AI. And we're just going to all just get in touch with nature. It's, it's just going to be like the, you know, the the magical uh island uh in uh in in some of these movies uh which one am i thinking of anyway they remade it with nicholas cage um uh yeah someone says hail greta um but we need to hold back that day so that that's that notion yeah well midsummer that was sort of a response to it i'm forgetting the movie um the moment teal imagines himself as holding back the tide and um i i don't know i i do do you how do you what do you make of this like he thinks he's jesus then he's got a messiah complex if he's waging war against the antichrist he's gonna yeah greta thunberg the antichrist who i just dropped the uh hitler youth greta thunberg meme in the chat yeah it reminded me of with the braids  she does oh yeah yeah  What? So he's figuring himself as Jesus, even though he more resembles these things. So there's an assumption of univocality, which is basically what many people say, which is basically just that... I'm not talking to you. Guys, you got to mute someone.  Who was that? Yeah. Okay. There's an assumption of univocality, which basically means that there are different authors to the Bible, of course, but that they're all inspired by the same Holy Spirit. And so something, you know, what occurs in Isaiah is a prophecy of what will occur with Jesus. They're from different testaments. They were written hundreds of years apart, et cetera, et cetera.  Yeah, someone mentioned the Wicker Man. That was the movie I was referencing. Yes. So we assume that Paul was evoking images that would be reiterated in the book of Revelation. But what do you make of all this? Yeah.  Adam, how do these concepts, how do they reoccur in the narrative of the book of Revelation? Here's a thought I have, okay? Peter Thiel has all this influence on the right wing, right? From J.D. Vance and Rumble, and what do we see in the right wing everywhere? end times prophecy like fear mongering yeah everybody's terrified about the new satanic panic the the demonic evil left the satanic evil west and then what does that do it scares everybody into it corrals them towards jesus yeah and and the prophecies are real what is what at the at the base level what is peter teal out there doing promoting and perpetuating this idea that the anti-christ is real the anti-christ is real then jesus is real And it's keeping everybody from the top level down with Peter Thiel on the Jewish plantation, on the Jewish theological plantation. From Tucker Carlson getting attacked by demons in his bag to Alex Jones constantly talking about Jesus and Fuentes and the Groypers, Christ is king. It aligns with that Peter Thiel, Donald Trump shilling and Charlie Kirk Christian revival.  That's what we're seeing at the basic level. I don't think Peter Thiel really believes in the Antichrist, but he's promoting the fear of the Antichrist, which in a weird inversion way is actually just promoting Jesus. Yeah, you know, I remember Andrew Tate said this a lot of times where he would be like, you know, I wasn't always a Christian, but you know, there's so much evil out there, you know, whores, whores.  when liberal white women, you know, transsexuals. And I said, if there's that much evil, then there must be a God. And so that was actually something that he repeated many times. And I've heard other people repeat that. I think even Tucker has said similar things.  And it's funny because, you know, Andrew Tate's his own self-fulfilling prophecy. Like, he creates the horrors that terrify him, basically. The Matrix. Yeah. He is his own Matrix. Yeah. Yeah. And you hear Tucker Carlson say these things as well, like, you know, I don't really know what I think about theology itself, but I just know that there's spiritual demons at play. He was talking about World War I and saying, oh, we heard about the Archduke and, you know, Franz Ferdinand and all that kind of stuff. But what we need to start talking about are the demons.  You know, it's like as if this is somehow insightful. He doesn't even explain how we should understand the First World War. They always say it's a spiritual war. Really, it's just a spiritual war. The enemy is Satan. So what is that telling you? It's we need to worship the Jewish Messiah and the God of Israel. That's like the subtext and the takeaway of that type of narrative. Yeah. Yeah. And what is saying that it's spiritual war even get you to other than some kind of Manichaean black and white good versus evil? It reduces your understanding of phenomena, basically.  Yeah, it makes you retarded. I just watched the whole Alex Jones. If you watch a baseball game, you'd be like, oh, the Mariners, they came back with three runs in the seventh inning against the Blue Jays. I don't know if they actually did that. I wasn't watching it. So that's an actual analysis. They had good starting pitching. But what they want to bring you to is there's a battle between black and white, good and evil, and it's fighting. It doesn't help you understand anything. Yeah.  It's like you're a broadcaster and your analysis is like angels in the outfield is real. And the home run was a home run because the angel blew it over the fence. Right.  Yeah, I was watching Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson, and that's what they were saying. Tucker's like, nobody gets so triggered when you talk about Jesus. They just hate Jesus so much. That's how you know it's true, because they hate it so much. That type of logic. And Alex Jones is like, you take the DMT, and you see other dimensions, and the spiritual clockwork elves are all around us, and it's a spiritual battle, and they're preying off your negativity. Yeah.  I watched the exact same clip that you watched. Yeah. All these Silicon Valley people with AI, they're taking DMT and they can see the demons. The demons are knocking to them. Yeah. Yeah. It's fucking nuts. Yeah. And it's like normal people see that and go, well, I guess I got to vote for the left because these right wing people are just out of their minds delusional. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I hadn't thought about it quite before, but I think that is basically what Peter Thiel is doing. More hyperstition, more prophecy is real, more satanic fear-mongering that just ultimately keeps everybody on the Jewish plantation that their theology is real. Yeah. And he's a big Israel guy. Does Israel benefit from the Goyim believing in the prophecies? Yes. Clearly. What happens to Israel in the book of Revelation, Adam? dude the the the in the revelation the christians get beheaded and the messiah comes or the antichrist comes and smites the nations smites the goyim treads the wine press which is like metaphor for like slaughtering everybody so yeah and but trust the plan trust the plan jesus will survive jesus is going to come and force them to convert that's why the jews have to survive till the end of times because for jesus to come and then for them to for them to finally believe in the messiah that was meant to conquer all of us mission accomplished every knee will bow yeah that's right ava mad max do you want to jump in  Yeah, this is a question for Adam. We kind of have like this modern myth of the Antichrist or Satan being this fallen angel thrown out of his father's kingdom, but I don't know if that's within the biblical text at all. So I'm wondering, would you know, is this like Book of Enoch stuff or does this come from any other ancient source or is this kind of like a modern invention? Yeah.  That's a good point. In Judaism and Christianity, the idea of Satan is very different. In Christianity, it progressed into something more, developed into more lore of the Antichrist being against God. Whereas in Judaism, he's more of like an angel working for God to provide a divine role. But yeah, it's not Satan... that was cast out of heaven because he rebelled right it was the fallen angel story is azazel which is the god that in yom kippur they give the scapegoat to is azazel and then in early like qumran and early christianity satan was known as as uh beliar was the name for satan too so satan kind of has different names and And then it like originally the notion of Satan cast out of heaven and I'll rather rule down below than up above. Isn't that John Milton? I mean, is there there's obviously a precedent for that or probably a precedent for it. I'm not sure about that, but also the idea that the serpent in the garden was Satan, that's a later development too. That's not what it says in Genesis. No, it doesn't directly say that. Mark actually thinks that that is the symbolism. Right. Yeah. But it doesn't say it. Right. And apparently Jews didn't think it until Christianity. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah.  But the idea that like being, this is what Christianity did to people that's so destructive. Christianity convinced Gentiles, non-Jews, that if you don't believe in magical Jews and their prophecies and that they were chosen and bow down to their sacrificed Messiah, that you're evil, demonic, satanic, antichrist. And like, where has that gotten us?  And how is that any different from the rabbis? You're evil, you're Amalek, you're anti-Semitic if you don't want to be a Noahide slave to the Moshiach. It's the same thing. And it's not exactly the same, exactly the same interpretation, but they're referencing and influenced by all the same verses in the Old Testament on what the Messiah is going to be.  So this whole idea, I'm proudly anti-Christ. I'm anti-Moshiach. All Christ, all Moshiachs, I'm against. Because it's a Jewish dictator that rules the world and subdues the nations, the Goyim. That's what being anti-Christ is. Yeah. Oh, and Richard, I just watched the replay of Tuesday's meeting, and I noticed you guys were talking about the Arnold Schwarzenegger Antichrist movie, End of Days. Right. I actually had a VHS copy of this growing up, and I was a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger fan. So I've seen it a ton. It's actually a pretty good movie. We were just talking about this on my stream the other day, too. That's funny.  I've not seen it yet. Is it good? I think it's good and entertaining. I don't know if it's particularly deep. I haven't seen it in a while, but it's pretty good. Actually, I think Schwarzenegger, it's like one of his better serious roles.  He fights with a demon in a church in the end scene. That's what I remember. And he makes a really gross morning protein shake with pizza and some weird shit. Pepto-Bismol, I think, was in it or something. Those are the only two things I remember from the movie. I watched it in the theaters. Maybe only in the theaters. What was it called again? End of Days. End of Days. oh dude i got something interesting the omen movie starts with the priest looking at the remake starts with the priest looking at a star and this is so crazy richard did you not see this no this christian zionist guy named tom horn who had a show called sky watch like waiting for the rapture waiting for some biblical event and He predicted that the tribulation would start on October 13th, which was the day that Trump signed his big Middle East peace thing, the covenant of the many. He predicted this in his book in 2021, that October 13th would be the beginning of the tribulation. And how he found that date was there's this asteroid that's going to come close to Earth and maybe even hit Earth in 2029. It's...  Greek or Egyptian God, Apophis, Apophis. Have you heard of this God? That's what they call it. So he took that date when it's supposed to come and went three and a half years. So halfway of the seven days of the tribulation. Hmm. And predicted almost five years ago that on October 13th would be the beginning of the tribulation, which is when the Antichrist signs the covenant of the many, like Trump just did, the king of kings with all the leaders there signing this Middle East peace deal.  Isn't that pretty crazy calling the day like that? Yeah, it's absolutely crazy. Hold on one more thing. This guy wrote the book, Donald Trump and the rabbis and the secret plan to rebuild the third temple. Oh, wow. Also.  And he died a few years ago, so we don't know what he's saying about this today. But crazy coincidence of a prediction. And it very likely could be they know when this asteroid is supposed to come. He has a rabbi friend, and they're just scripting and orchestrating shit. And that's how he knew. Yeah.  It's related to Wormwood, the Wormwood Prophecy. I've heard about that. Is there like a video that sums this up or something? Yeah, I played his video on my stream yesterday. He has videos, lots of videos about this. The Wormwood Prophecy 2029. Okay, let me just look at this real quick.  I'm just curious what this is. I have it. It's Revelation 8, verses 10 to 11. Okay. The third angel sounded his trumpet. A great star blazing like a torch fell from the sky on the third of the rivers and the springs and the water. The name of the star is Wormwood. Oh, and this asteroid is going to come so close that we're going to be able to see it with our naked eye, and some astronomers say that it's actually going to hit us. Wow. In 2029.  Let's just watch this real quick. Object making its way closer to Earth every day. are completely abnormal to what we've seen in the past with other objects some of the news coming out right now indicates that there could be a massive psyop going on at the same time there's another object heading towards the earth said to be here in 2029 this one looks way more concerning some are saying this could even be the star falling from the sky that the book of revelation has warned us about also known as wormwood Avi Loeb has been the person who's really brought a lot of attention to Three-Eye Atlas, and seeing how the world is moving closer day by day to the fulfillment of End Times Bible prophecies, it was really weird to hear him say that this Three-Eye Atlas could usher in a messianic age.  When you have an external threat, people tend to unite. And that, in a way, is a messianic era. If you think about the arrival of the Messiah, maybe that will come from another star in the sense that it will bring peace to Earth among all humans.  Jesus is the only messiah. Bible prophecy tells us that a false messiah, the antichrist, comes before Jesus, the true messiah, comes back. That is what everybody should be expecting. And everything is lining up for these deceptions and great tribulations to come about. potentially even these interstellar objects and government officials openly pushing forth this whole narrative that could usher this all in. We'll look more at those two things in just a moment. But first, something strange that just happened with 3-Eye Atlas is that it was just passing by Mars with its satellites and supposedly its telescopes. All of this within the last 48 hours, and these could have got the best images of 3-Eye Atlas that we've seen so far, but due to the government shutdown, NASA being shut down, supposedly all the other government agencies shut down, they were not able to get any images. Interesting timing, don't you think? Here's some more strange information surrounding Three-Eye Atlas, and then we'll look into Apophis, the Book of Revelation, some prophecies associated with that, and the potential for psyops surrounding all of this that we should all be aware of. We did get one report that as 3I Atlas gets closer now to the sun, telescopes here on Earth are picking up other objects flying alongside it. Is that accurate?  Well, there are always objects. The question is whether we see unusual activity. And in fact, I tasked my research team at the Galileo Project to monitor the sky for any unusual activity because it's possible that if it's an alien probe, that in fact it would release some mini-probes that will visit the planets.  You know, we should not assume anything. It's a blind date and we should watch the other side, you know, just in case there is a serial killer there. I was a co-author on a paper with Adam Hibbert and Adam Crowell where we said the orbit, the trajectory of this object,  It appears to be quite remarkable. It arrives within 5 degrees of the orbital plane of the Earth around the Sun. And the chance of that happening randomly is 0.2%. And moreover, it will arrive closest to the Sun when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. And moreover, if you just play with the arrival time randomly, you would notice that only one out of 20,000 arrival times would come as close to the inner planets like Jupiter.  Mars or Venus. So that is an unusual coincidence. And why would such a trajectory be so unusual? Well, one possibility is if it was designed by some intelligent civilization. It also comes towards us from the direction of the galactic center, from the Milky Way center where there are lots of stars and it's very difficult to notice it. That's why we discovered it so late. By now it's impossible for us to launch a rocket that will intercept with it. Before we get into the Wormwood, Book of Revelation, and Apophis theory, let's just take a moment to recognize that there is for sure psyops going on all around us. In connection with all of this, global governments and organizations could very well be conditioning the public for all of the deceptions that could be associated with the revealing of alleged alien life.  which in reality is dark fallen forces connected to Satan and his momentary power. Like, it's pretty weird how Jeremy Korbel says that soon we're going to hear of a UFO mothership heading towards Earth, but to not believe that lie. And then about three weeks later, Three-Eye Atlas comes on the scene. Deceptions and evil forces are at work in this world, but so is God. God is infinitely more powerful than Satan, And we can look to the Bible for verses to use in our prayers to call on God's power for deliverance against these evil forces and deceptions. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. above all taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one but the lord is faithful who will establish you and guard you from the evil one as christians we can use god's word in our prayers to use it to our power to call on the lord to bring deliverance to our lives or even to the mass deceptions that we're seeing around the world use god's words in your prayers Chase Hughes was in the military for over 20 years and he's helped other government agencies with their techniques and processes and he says that we are in the middle of a big psyop. The guy that teaches psyops.  telling you that we are in a psyop, a 1000% big time psyop. And that does not mean that I have some kind of x-ray vision and I can see the puppet masters up above the stage. I'm not saying I don't research that stuff, but I do research these techniques.  And they're definitely here. And it looks like this is the same process that's happened all over the world where psyops were sped up and weren't allowed to mature before the next phase began. And I think people are saying... They've said 10 times now, it's a psyop. What is the psyop? I mean, what is the psyop that an asteroid is going to destroy the Earth?  or alien life is going to come visit us. Or that it's not. I've never seen this Avi Jewish guy talking about all this stuff. Mm-hmm. They keep saying it's a psyop, but nobody explains what the psyop is, what the angle. Flat Earth, your chat says Flat Earth vindicated again.  Yeah, I don't know. This is just like Doomsday 2012 stuff all over again. They're playing both sides because they seem to be suggesting that this is all real, but then also they bring in the, oh, but the government's going to try to trick you. about it as well it's how though they're the government's going to cover up that it really is jesus returning on a cloud and heaven's gate and we can all just commit suicide and go off with it what is the psyop i i think aliens i mean there's a new movie that i saw a a a trailer for that actually included marco rubio and some other politicians but it's like the the days of disclosure  or something is what it's called. And it doesn't, again, directly tell you what it's about, but it's clearly about alien crafts that they have found. Like...  I don't know what to say. There's actually a really good video by Thunderfoot on this. Like all of this, it's UFOs basically, but what are they called? They're called like unidentified aerial. UFOs are really demons. I heard it from Tucker. I learned it from the podcast. They're fucking virtual entities.  Yeah, it's birds. It's birds. It's birds, birds, birds flying low to the ocean is clearly the best explanation for these things. You don't need to make leaps into the unknown. They don't obey the laws of physics or something. Yeah.  It's military people maybe without a lot of sleep seeing birds and getting freaked out. But are they real birds or are they drone birds? Because I've heard about fake drone birds. Birds are in fact not real. Speaking of the psyops also, Netflix had a movie basically very similar to this plot where a couple astronomers found a comet that was going to crash and then they did the math and oh yeah it was don't look up yes it's pretty funny actually i remember seeing it crash into the earth and that's like apparently what really is happening with this apophis  Well, it's funny because it's like it's almost like doesn't have a metaphor. I think the original metaphor for that movie is written by a political writer or he wrote the story or something. David Sirota, who's a left wing political writer, but he wrote it as a metaphor for climate change. But then when it was released, it became a metaphor for covid.  It's like the right wing being like, oh, it's fine. You don't need a mask or whatever. I think that's how it was taken. But it's almost like it's not a metaphor. At some point, it's going to be people denying that this asteroid is coming. It's revelation of the method, man. It's predictive programming, bro. I learned it from Ian Carroll and Candace Owens. But I've seen this guy, Ted Hughes. He's like a body language expert. Yeah.  What is the PSYOP? Like, don't just tell me that there are people out there doing this. I mean, like, what is it? What is an analogy? What PSYOP has the CIA pulled on Nicaragua or something back in the day? Like, what are you talking about?  They're covering up the true demonic entities that are in the spiritual warfare. They don't want you to know Jesus is real. They're hiding the firmament in the flat earth. They want you to believe that you're on a little speck of dust floating through space and that you're not the center of the universe created by God and made in his image and loved and loved and he loves you. But the funny thing about this, and I know you're joking, but like, I almost take the opposite approach to this. And Ross Douthat, who I've started to like more and more as he's gotten older, actually. I found him pretty tedious back in the day. But anyway.  He interviewed this Catholic who was an academic who talked about first encounters with aliens. And what she said is, oh, you know, I was trying to find an analogy to these encounters with aliens. What I found was medieval people who would like see the Holy Spirit or see Jesus. Yeah. And, and, and, or later on people who would see him in the sky, famous ones are on a toast, the most notorious one. And so she's like, so what's really happening? Are they seeing aliens? Are they seeing Jesus? And I think in this weird way, it's both like there's a Spielbergian.  like image of the aliens as angels and as the Messiah. Like it's sort of both. Maybe they couldn't pull off Jesus coming back in this massive psyop in this day and age, like a guy wearing a robe and a beard, you know, holding a glass of water and a glass of wine. Like, I don't think they can pull that off. And so what they're going to do is like, they're aliens, but they're benign.  Yeah, right. Project Bluebeams with the notion that aliens were going to unite the world, but they were going to be benign, wasn't it? no it's jesus there it's jesus well there's different theories about project okay one is that aliens will come and that will unite the world that's what that avi guy was talking about yeah uh what i was thinking is if if like the whole world like remember we had the movies growing up there's deep impact and armageddon asteroids coming to hit us so if like if everybody starts fear-mongering about this asteroid like is is spacex and space force donald trump and elon gonna team up to save the world from this asteroid yeah  Yes, definitely. They're going to hire some... Wasn't it Reagan that said like, oh, what could you... Sorry, go ahead. So they're going to hire some like labor union guys from the drillers. And we're like, we got a special project. Only you guys can do it. You, you know, demographically representative... beer drinking cool guys we're gonna send you up there to destroy the asteroid irl ben affleck's yeah save the world but reagan said that too right he's like what could unite better than the whole world to unite the world than is alien a threat from an alien species right yeah he's right that's been the maga zionist uh script apparently  But it could play to both people. So for the liberals, the alien could be like the ultimate liberal.  And then for the Christians, it could be Christ. You know what I mean? Like there could be some highly intelligent and benign, like wonderful being like from another planet who comes down to save us. And it's the same figure of Christ. It's just in a new form. They're like, oh no, that's not that thing from that dusty old book. No, no, no, no. This is some like super intelligence being that loves us.  The guy that was on with Tucker. I don't know if you're just getting the screen right now if you want to record us or not. I don't care. Tucker had that one no-name guy on and he was like, yeah, AI's demons and they're all into the occult and stuff and we should be totally scared. We gotta believe in Jesus. Right. I saw that guy. He's like a surfer dude type guy. Yeah. Exactly. Nobody knew who he was but he was on Tucker's  He's like, yeah, I'm going to butcher this, but talk about Kabbalah. And he's like, Kabbalah is basically like Babylonian magic that turned into ones and zeros and the AI gods that are going to fulfill revelation. It's just like, dude, you are shut up. You're an idiot. I think Kabbalah is Jewish.  Jewish mysticism and fan fictions on the Torah, basically, is what it is. And he's like, yeah, it's totally real and satanic and AI is all Kabbalah gods that's going to fulfill revelation. That's what he said.  Yeah. All of the conservatives are in this. Even a secular person like Megyn Kelly, who I think is actually Catholic, but even she will say things like don't like witches. They hexed Charlie Kirk like they didn't know what they were doing. They were playing with real like it's just so funny. It's like they all believe in this stuff.  Yeah, I covered that. I covered that clip of Mega Kelly. Yeah, the Etsy witches. Yeah. Yeah. The real problem with America is the satanic Luciferian globalists and the witches and the sorcerers and those Jews and their blood-drinking black magic. Babylonian mystery religion, black magic. They got magical powers. They killed God. All we can do is pray to Jesus. That's the only way. We need our Jesus power to defeat the evil satanic Luciferian clockwork elves, DMT.  They're going to pull all this stuff. Let's just watch a little more of this intriguing video. think this is playing yes there we go well this is bonkers or this is ridiculous just crazy like in your it's just in your face yeah uh it's from the left from the right from from everywhere yeah uh and it has nothing to do with left or right and i think that is in itself a whole nother discussion yes but  We're seeing a timeline being sped up. We're seeing things done more and more in the open because there's probably not time for the previous step to mature to get our minds ready to receive the next one. I see. That's what it is. The way that he mentions that the PSYOP is bigger than politics, bigger than left and right, just makes me think, well, what's bigger than politics in the world right now? Well, the only other thing that's kind of taking over the narrative is the whole aliens could be extraterrestrials from other planets that are visiting Earth. That is now fully mainstream. Every week almost, we're hearing of a new government. There's clearly a shooting star. Yes.  Here's Anna Polina. This is on another thing. She is very Russian, this very attractive former stripper, what I've heard. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But she also got these JFK files from the Kremlin, and she just released them. She's talked about the JFK session. I think there was another shooter. It certainly might very well be. I don't really...  take it from her. She just said that the Chinese were behind Charlie Kirk's assassination, too. Yeah. Coming from her, it makes me think that Oswald acted alone, to be honest. But she's done all sorts of things, and she was also involved in bringing these fraudsters to Congress who were like, do you have proof? No, I don't have proof myself, but I know a guy who  who's seen the craft. She also posted that hoax of where the ADL, on their website, they were condemning Christian identity, which is like some fringe, not real Christian. Oh, yes, she posted that, yeah. Yeah, she was the biggest account that promoted that thing. Yeah.  New whistleblowers, new videos. I mean, disclosure has practically fully come. Even Congressman Tim Bruchette was saying a few weeks ago that he thinks there's multiple alien bases at the bottom of the ocean. What if... Even... Even some wingnut congressman from Tennessee believes that aliens live under the ocean. Even him! Like, of course he believes that... Even MTG thinks there's space lasers. Yeah, exactly.  He's, like, the most likely person to believe this nonsense. Remember, too, like, the former space intelligence guy from Israel said Trump's working with the Galactic Federation and the aliens? Yeah. That's this level stuff. This is the PSYOP, if anything. These are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth, that are  who knows how, and that we,  You know, we think they're coming in from way out. Maybe they did millennial ago, but they're here and they're in these deep water areas. And that's why, I mean, like we say, we know more about the face of the moon than we do what's going on there. And we have a higher propensity of sightings around these five or six, I believe, deep water areas. And so to me, it just...  It creates a question there. And then when we have naval personnel telling me that we have these sightings and that there's these underwater craft they're chasing that are doing hundreds of miles an hour. And the best we've got is something that does maybe just a little under 40 miles an hour. I'm fully convinced from my own personal experiences, from looking at the research, from listening to other people's testimonies, from what the Bible says is coming prophetically in the future and the connections made there, that this whole alien phenomenon is 100% connected to Satan's fallen kingdom. Whether it's demons, principalities, powers, fallen angels, or some other force, we may not always know exactly what it is, but we can know that it's rooted in Satan's kingdom. Praise God, Jesus Christ has authority over every realm, in the spiritual heavenly realm and in the physical earthly realm. And Jesus came and spoke to them saying, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. What's interesting about these two interstellar objects headed towards Earth is that they both have their connections to fallen angels. Atlas is a figure from Greek mythology, and he's known as one of the most famous Titans. The Titans from Greek mythology are very similar to what a lot of the ancient cultures believed, and it's that there were these other higher deities that came down, mingled with mankind, created giant offspring, created hybrid monsters, and that's exactly what Genesis 6-4 and other places in the Old Testament and extra biblical texts tell us, that the fallen angels fell to the earth, these were the fallen sons of God, and they intermingled with mankind and the animals and created giants and monsters.  Apophis is no different. It's depicted as a great serpent, an enemy of the sun god Ra in ancient Egyptian religion. The interstellar object Apophis is actually appearing to be a way bigger threat than Three-Eye Atlas. Unless, of course, with Three-Eye Atlas we get a full-on alien deception disclosure, then that's a different story.  But Apophis already has a lot of strange things connected to it. Its official name is 99942 Apophis, which obviously has three nines in it, which could be three sixes upside down. It's a serpent false god from ancient Egyptian spirituality. This article on Apophis is already painting a pretty strange narrative for it.  giant god of darkness asteroid may not escape Earth unscathed. But what I'm most interested in in Apophis is Tom Horn's revelation on it. Five years ago, way before anyone else was even mentioning it, or before Three-Eye Atlas was even known, Tom Horn got a revelation on how Apophis could bring about Wyrmwood from the Book of Revelation. Then the third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became Wormwood, and many men died from the water because it was made bitter. Early in 2019, the most vivid and frankly terrifying, terrifying vision in the middle of the night, more real than this muted matrix we live in here is, scared me to the bone, and I won't go into all the details because it's a lot of details, but this one little thing. looking up into the heavens and what looked to me like a fiery dragon moving serpent-like, racing towards the earth, right? Then, you know how dreams are, my point of view suddenly changed and now I'm up above the object looking down at it and I can see it's not a fiery dragon, it's a giant rock. and it's moving through space and the way it's turning and the way the sunlight is moving up and down on the grades on at the contour, it's giving it the appearance that it's moving serpent like through space, racing towards the earth. Bottom line is when I woke up, I jumped up and I almost fell out of bed. I was so scared, cold sweat, grabbed my paper to start writing down that I keep next to my bed.  but it was as if a voice spoke. I don't know if this was just in my head, I really can't say, but one word, apophis. And The only thing I knew Gary, I knew that there was an ancient Egyptian chaos dragon, a god of chaos by the name of Apophis, didn't really know too much about it. And I knew that NASA had named an asteroid Apophis  didn't know anything about that. But what I had seen in this dream was definitely an asteroid. It wasn't a giant serpent like I first thought it was. And so I got up out of bed, went to my computer, and that's how all of this got started. I started doing research on the asteroid Apophis, what NASA was saying about it, what they today are saying about it, and other uh astronomers and one thing led to the other which led of course to the writing of the book but also persuaded me that nasa is involved in a cover-up of what they actually know about this space rock tom horn would always say through the years that god always has the final say and that the lord can change timelines according to his will just like jonah and joel repentance and turning to god postponed or took away the judgment that was determined for them The book of Revelation will unfold because the Lord has declared it, but the timeline is completely up to God. The most important thing that we can do now is to humble ourselves and seek God's face and turn from our wicked ways. This is the same call that Tom gave in the concluding words of his book on Wormwood. If you would be so inclined to trust in the Lord at this time, I invite you to pray with me now. wow there it is i love how they have their out like they make all these bold predictions and like but but nobody knows the time and day but the lord and it can always change so they have an excuse if nothing happens yeah but we all know apophis was named by nasa those satanic occult nazi scientists at nasa of course they were behind that so what do you think  I do worry about these asteroids. I mean, at some point, it's going to happen. And it's happened before. We'll stop them. Elon and Trump will save us. Elon and Bruce Willis. I do worry about that. I think it's real.  I do think, I don't believe, I think sadly we are alone in the universe. And even if there is other life forms, it's too far away for us to ever make contact. And I think that's almost like a tremendous tragedy. Yeah. that we we won't be able to reach another life form now that other life form might be microscopic it might exist in a way that we could never possibly communicate with it but i i do think that that's a tragedy of existence that we are in effect alone and but i i also think that you don't think there's any life elsewhere in the universe no i i that's what i said i think there is they can't reach here we won't be able to reach them and even if we could reach them we might be talking about like something like a bacteria or or some thing that we couldn't ever communicate with it's it's not going to be like a vulcan spock coming down and we shake his hand i think that was a scene in first contact from star trek it's not going to be like that yeah and i think that's actually a tragedy aliens i i i'm  I very strongly don't believe in any aliens visiting Earth. I don't think any other life form from any other solar system could ever reach here. It's just impossible. But I do think there is life on other planets. I think most likely. If you think about the odds of life arising, I bet it's out there. Yeah.  And it might have even existed a trillion years ago, and it's already gone through its cycle. And I just think I have a lot of tragic thoughts about this subject. I also do sort of agree with the notion of...  If people don't believe in God, they'll believe in all sorts of ridiculous things. I do agree with this. Nietzsche himself thought of the death of God as a tragedy. We're going to be unmoored and the sun is gone and we don't know up and down. And I do think that part of the crisis that Americans are facing and people around the world is the end of the American dream, this economic cycle that we're reaching. It's never going to get any better. You can't afford anything. You're not going to be able to live your life. And I think they're just ripe to reach for something. And UFOs might very well be that thing.  to fill up the God-sized hole in their heart. All the things that Christians say, there's a kernel of truth to them, actually. Yeah. They're both apocalyptic in a way, too. You can have your Bible in times apocalypse, or you can have your Armageddon. We're going to get hit by a space rock. I saw a comment, space rock nationalism. That's funny. His vision about the dragon, too, that reminds me of Dinesh D'Souza has a big... movie coming out right now it's in theaters right now it's based on the book by the ultra zionist jewish uh jonathan kahn one of the most influential oh the blood moon character  Yeah, I think so. I think he might have done something about Blood Moon. He had the Harbinger, the book about how 9-11 was some prophetic event that's going to usher in the end times, right? So Dinesh D'Souza produced his, or directed and produced his documentary based on his book, and the dragon is like this satanic figure that's going to turn against Israel or something like that. And this guy's talking about having dreams of a dragon attacking us and  Interesting. I'm skeptical of his story. He seemed to admit that he, the dragon prophecy. I want to go see this film. Me too. I want to have a watch party on my stream. Yeah. When is this coming out? It's out. Oh, it's out. It came out. Oh, okay. Netanyahu's in it. Grazing Jesus. yes yeah here is the dragon's prophecy i don't know if you can see that um i i'm sad this might not be playing perhaps i can uh stream it or something yeah oh um regular guy you have a question Yes, in regards to the whole right wing obsession with the Antichrist, it just seems like in terms of types of Christianity, I actually did a bit of digging before asking this, that, you know, there's been the big push towards Catholicism. And before that, obviously, Eastern Orthodoxy with Heimbach being the spearhead of that whole thing now it's catholicism those two branches of christianity are the least talkative about the end times in terms and it seems like protestantism which historically has been compared to islam in its emphasis on the book and the interpretation of the book not the church fathers and all that Protestantism is really the most focused on the end times, along with Islam, the Dijal, the one-eyed magician, and the Mahdi. It just seems like that's going to – do you think that's going to sort of run up against the emphasis on Catholicism that – with J.D. Vance's conversion? Yeah. because the Catholic Church has kept it very light in terms of they don't promote the Left Behind series, which really was geared towards Protestants. It was post-mill and pre-mill, I think is one. So this notion that the end times already occurred was something that I guess Augustine  this is the notion of the city of God and so on. And so this thing already occurred. It's not, we're not waiting for the book of revelation. Protestants don't agree with that. And they believe in a big apocalyptic scene, Gog and Magog war against Israel. Yeah. And the Muslims believe that as well. They also share the emphasis on Gog and Magog being these Northern invaders and  Yeah, I almost don't think it will run up against a brick wall of Catholicism. I think these guys will get into it. And Teal is certainly amplifying that. accelerating it full full preterism is none of the major denominations believe in full preterism that like the end times all all happened already even catholicism and eastern orthodox still believe that revelation has to be fulfilled that the antichrist is going to rule the earth before jesus returns they all do believe in revelation and still a future end time scenario and It's true that the Protestants are more obsessed with it and that they believe in the rapture and different versions of tribulation, post-trib, pre-trib stuff, but they don't advertise it as much, but they do still believe in Antichrist and end time stuff.  Eastern Orthodox and Catholicism. But there's also a bigger cultural focus on it in Protestantism, like saying, oh, in the early 20th century, people were scared of barcodes and department stores heralding it in. And I think even people, Protestants tried to identify Mussolini as being a kind of Antichrist figure as well. Maybe they have the awareness that it makes Christians look crazy so they don't advertise it too much. But if you press them on them or if you listen to Catholics or like I've heard Jay Dyer talk about Antichrist and Jesus returning and stuff too. So they believe that same stuff also. um i gotta wrap though i gotta i gotta yeah thank you it's been i usually do two but we did three today i gotta go get the girls ready for bed okay it is late thank you for being here this is fun yeah all right i'll talk to you soon okay take care um chad and then kevin so chad Yeah, I suppose just briefly, you know, I remember Mark was on a call one time and... Oh, what was that? Hello? Yeah. Yes, we hear you. Why don't... Yeah, sorry. Like, someone's got their blinker on. It sounds like maybe they're unmuted. But... uh talked about how yeah like there there's the alien thing has legs excuse me guys mute yourselves rick i keep muting rick why are you unmuting yeah stay muted my friends okay go um So the alien thing has legs on the right, and he speculated that, and probably beyond speculation, it was probably more of a prediction that some enterprising sort of sociopathic individual would seize the opportunity and create like a Q-esque kind of cult around aliens. And, um, I wonder if, I mean, I mean, like maybe, maybe not quite a cult, you know, but I mean, certainly maybe like a new kind of QAnon thing. I mean, like, are we seeing that here? Um, or, um, or, or, or is it maybe something less, um, serious than that, but it does seem because Ian Carroll and Candace Owens have been doing a lot of alien posting lately. And I am seeing this kind of swirl around more on the right, um, I know that these people that also seem to post a lot of pro-Russian content, like Carol and Candace, they're constantly engaging in this exercise of audience farming and trying to just pick up on whatever little issue is popular on the right. But...  Anyway, yeah, those are just some thoughts. Yeah, I mean, I was saying something very similar and I might very well have picked it up from Mark because we have talked about this together. But yeah, it's this weird, it's like a substitution but also a conflation of angels or the return of Christ going on with this obsession with aliens. They're really primed to want aliens to visit us.  Kevin? Oh, hello. Thanks for letting me speak. Anyway, I had this memory just listening to this discussion tonight. I don't know if it was a talk or an interview with Peter Thiel. it could have been almost 10 years ago, but he was saying, he was laying out what he thought about where the world was going. He was like, there's two competing visions. And one of them is environmentalism and the green movement. And another one is like trad Christianity, uh,  dictatorship or like going back to the like medieval times or something, something like that. And, um, I think he said he preferred the environmentalist one. And that, that's just a memory I have. I tried to find that during this like discussion, I was trying to find it, but that was, I don't know. Do you, do you, does anyone remember that? What do you said? I prefer the green movement. And I don't remember that exactly. This is one thing that I was looking at today. Um, From a Christian perspective, I think people always make a mistake of trying to put Christ into some sort of political agenda. If you try to do, that's the most straightforward way to misinterpret Christianity. If anything, Christ was extremely skeptical of politics when Christ said that he was the son of God. On one level, this is some theological metaphysical statement, but on another level, it's an anti-political statement because Augustus,  was the son of Caesar. Caesar was divinized after his death. And the official son of God was Augustus Caesar. And so when Christ said that he was the son of God, he was really saying that the emperor was not the son of God. He did not believe that the political order was divinely ordained. You can see how that aligns with his libertarianism and seasteading and network state and all of this. It's just this attack on powers and principalities.  Um, I think this is this is honest. I want to talk about what before we go. Okay, this is actually not the one that I was thinking of. I want to play one thing from Fuentes, because I find this actually concerning. uh of Fuentes just sort of falling back into being a Republican booster to be honest let me find it here real quick and um I'll play it yeah here it is okay um and this this actually relates to much of what we've been talking about  Okay. I mean, these are foaming at the mouth of lunatics. This isn't some schizophrenic on the street corner. These are high-powered people doing this. They literally want us dead, and they make no bones about that. They're not even hiding it anymore. And like you said, if they get back in power, they will use it against us. If they come back in 2028, and, you know, we disagree on Vance. We've gone back and forth on that before, but I continue to believe. A Republican's got to win in 28, whoever it is, because if the left comes back to power, they're going to put you in jail. They're going to put me in jail. It's going to be a war on us. They're going to open the borders up. It's going to be 10 million more illegals. And so I think people don't get bitching at Republicans and critique him to make them better.  Okay, but I'm not a lesser two evils guy. But this is even lesser two evils. I mean, with the Republicans, we have a populist beachhead. We're reforming it. With the Democrats, as you said, they're just getting worse. I mean, it's completely, I mean, one is cyanide, one is dog shit. Well, I'd rather eat dog shit than cyanide.  Right. Well, and look, I tried to even make an overture to the left, which I was heavily critiqued for on the right. Over the past couple of years, me and the left have found common cause in criticizing the genocide in Gaza. And I've even made an overture as a Christian and saying that liberals and Christians, you know, we sort of have something similar going on. We have the sympathy for the poor and the downtrodden.  They have rejected that wholeheartedly. I mean, you see there's a piece in current affairs seething for practically 2,000 words. He's a Nazi. He's a Nazi. He loves Hitler. He's got to go. It's like there can be no alliance with these people. They literally hate us. They don't even see us as human. They're not looking to debate. And they're so radical. Whenever they get power, they get more and more radical in a country, and then they start destroying themselves. Right. Shit inside of it.  Okay, guys, the muting. Why is this hard? Yeah, let's just mute people. I find this actually very worrisome.  I mean, I'm my own person, obviously. We don't need to follow what Nick says, but I did feel like I would agree with Nick nine times out of ten. Um... This is the logic that you hear from Republicans constantly, which is that we might, oh, does politics not matter? Might you vote Democratic? No, you can't. They want to trans your kids. No, you can't. They want to inject you with a vaccine. No, you can't. They literally want you dead.  And when you make the stakes that high, you just vote GOP and support GOP. Now, Nick has said never Vance and so on. That didn't sound never Vance right there.  He said, you know, I have my criticism. I have my problems with you, Alex, about J.D. Vance, but any Republican has to win. That seems like I'm going to vote for J.D. Vance in 2028. So I don't know what to say. This idea that they're going to throw you all in jail. I mean, there was obviously a lot of lawfare done against Alex Jones. And I found that whole lawsuit to be pretty egregious, even if somewhat deserved, to be honest, in terms of Alex Jones's discussion of the school shooting. I don't know. I have a little bit of ambivalence about it. But I did think the, you know, billion and a half or whatever it is, is just completely absurd.  But I don't know. The idea that these liberals are so crazy and totalitarian that they're going to put us all in jail. I mean, Yarwin has said something similar. I'm going to flee the country. You hear this. I mean, I don't really fear the liberals, to be honest. And I think... I didn't vote for Trump, but I am happy that Trump has ended some of these things that we could just call woke, like biological men and women's sports and gender affirming care and all this stuff. They seem to have been ended and the liberals seem to be actually happy that they're ended because they've moved on to other things.  And they're talking about Gaza in an authentic way. They're talking about affordability in an authentic, if maybe misguided, way. But I just don't see it in terms of all of these like Antifa is going to get elected and they're just going to come round us up and throw us into prison. And we need to desperately vote Republican in order to prevent that. I'm sorry. That just sounds like a... cope, I guess, is the right word, but just an extreme justification for acting in this basic bitch way of voting for Republicans. It's almost more radical to say to politics don't matter or to even vote for Democrats on some issue than it is to make this so existential. I mean, again, throughout my entire life,  I've heard about this of, you know, this is the most important election of our lifetime. That was 2008. You got to vote for McCain. That was 2010. You got to support the Tea Party. That was even 2012. Ah, we don't like Romney, but we can't have another age of Obama. We'll have full on communism if we do that.  2020, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It's not new. And it's a very, very typical right-wing mindset where it's this short-term thinking of if we don't do this, the world is going to explode. And I just don't buy it. I don't think I'm going to be thrown into prison if Gavin wins in 2028. I guess you can clip this when I'm in prison.  So I don't know. I think, you know, Nick has been going on this generational run, which means going on a lot of podcasts. But he obviously has broken into the mainstream, but he's broken into it in the sense of being a conservative figure. And I don't know. I find that worrisome, to be honest. I mean, again, he can do whatever the hell he wants.  I can do whatever the hell I want. I'm my own man. And obviously Mark and myself and this group were headed in our own direction. But I was sort of feeling a wavelength connection, mind meld with Fuentes and a lot of things. And stuff like this is a little bit worrisome. when you're just sort of agreeing and amplifying with Alex Jones, Alex Jones is a crazy retarded person who votes for the GOP. That's what he is. And I don't know, I don't want to be that. And I don't admire that kind of thing, but you know, Well, he's also talked about how he gave props to Vance for covering over this college group chat leak, which is interesting. Because he's covered it today and yesterday, basically playing apologetics, which is interesting. I mean, I guess it is better to do what Vance did, but I think I would probably emphasize the problems in his response than pat him on the back. It's like that is true that if another Republican had been vice president, he would have been like, this is just terrible. I'm embarrassed. I apologize to Vance.  all my friends for this chat. And Vance did deflect and do whataboutism and said, oh, we can't take this stuff seriously. They're just young boys in chat rooms. I mean, I get it. I mean, again, I get how that's better and whatever, but it's a little bit worrisome. I think maybe the assassination of Charlie Kirk affected Nick, much like he was full-throatedly in support of Donald Trump after the assassination attempt, as were other people. And that changed with Vance, actually. So we'll see. We'll see. In regards to the shutdown, it just seems like This isn't really news, but I've heard it's poised to go for a long time, and starting November, EBT and SNAP or whatever is basically going to run into problems. Do you think that Trump is trying to essentially bait people into doing bread riots to clamp down and maybe cancel the election? Yeah.  like he is with Chicago. Yeah, I mean, look, this is all sort of Rachel Maddow's stuff, but I don't think it's unfounded. I mean, the other thing is the vote character from the Heritage Foundation. They're basically going to shut down the government and then not reopen it, or at least not reopen it at full capacity. This is a more effective way of doing doge. um it's all very interesting um i don't think this is totally i i don't think we should just block this theory out of our minds and say it's a liberal fever dream so you've read that ebt is going to run out of cash Or Snap is going to run into something about Snap running into issues or something, which I don't even know if that's... I've had a debit card rejected. Well, that's always embarrassing when that happens. But to have your EBT card rejected, that's embarrassing. Well, they're saying that the terrorists are covering over the WIC and Snap's program right now. But yeah, eventually they're going to run out. What is WIC? Yeah.  It's like the thing that helps new mothers that are poor or something. Oh, okay. Do they get diapers or something? It's a food thing, I think. Okay. Women with infants and children. Okay, I see. Yeah, it's basically like Schedule F and Doge. You know, Yarvin's talked about rage and all this stuff. It's a slow version of getting the... It's a furtherance of Doge. Undervote, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Or maybe if Trump can't bait people into rioting to do the big clampdown, maybe he'll just stage some kind of event where something – or like some kind of left-wing version of the 9-11 where a bunch of Luigi Mangione-esque characters kill a bunch of seniors because they're mad about –  paying into social security as a means to go after the left quote unquote. Well, the no Kings rally apparently have a lot of like the American communist party is apparently affiliated with, uh, some of this, these no Kings in New York. It's strange. That is interesting. Uh, I've seen Republican never Trumpers advertise. No Kings. No, yeah. No Kings. Um,  I went to a No Kings. I don't know if you guys remember. I guess it was back in the spring or something or early summer. It was their attempt to do the sort of like they were sad that there wasn't like a big post-Trump Women's March or rioting in the Capitol. And they felt that they didn't like say something to Trump out of spite at the time. So they wanted to rush back and do the big demonstration to remind the public that they exist.  Yeah. It was very Tea Party-esque, I remember, when I saw it. I think it was... When was it? In June or something like that? Yeah, I think so. And it was like, you know, we're the people, we're rising up, we believe in this constitution! You know, it was that type of vibe. Might be different elsewhere, but...  We'll we'll see. I mean, I don't know. I mean, again, I'm just reiterating stances that I see from liberals, but I think the liberals are on to something like, is this the Stephen Miller plan? to do these ice raids at a very dramatic fashion that is in a fashion that's going to inspire a response. And I mean, yeah, the EBT runs out of cash.  I mean, I don't know what to say. And then they basically do something. They burn something down or they shoot someone in the administration. And then you have carte blanche to go after them and crack down on them harder. And, you know, real social unrest. Yeah. Could be an excuse to suspend the election. Yeah. It's turbo BLM riots. It could be worse than Minneapolis, but.  Yeah. It's a genius strategy on the part of Trump, if that's what they're doing. But at the same time, I mean, the left hasn't really bit the bait majorly. No. Which I guess there are times to lay down and pretend to be dead, even if there's a good chance you're going to get kicked with steel toes. I agree. They have not really taken the bait, as you said. But don't you think if EBT and all these benefits are going to run out with the government shutdown, isn't that going to cause the Dems to fold their hand? In what way? Won't they just sign the budget agreement with the Republicans if all this stuff is shutting down? Oh, I see. But that's assuming that it's the Democrats who are doing this. The Republicans are in control. Don't you think they seem to like this? I would imagine that this is kind of the plan, like a regular guy was saying, but I think the Dems are the ones holding it up right now, aren't they? I don't think so. I think that's the Republican propaganda. Oh, well. I mean, there are clear disagreements, there's no doubt, but I don't know.  Part of me feels that the public really isn't capable of bread rioting anymore. I guess that's just such a 1990s way of viewing things. I'm not convinced they're incapable either. In December, if they can't afford stuff because they're living on EBT, I think they might riot.  Well, you can just keep your minds off the fact you're starving. Modern entertainment's pretty advanced. I mean, Battlefield 6 came out, and it's a pretty impressive game. Yeah, but at some point, you're going to want to... Can you use DEBT with a DoorDash? Not sure. Never tried it.  And there's also plenty of places to get free food, and there's also dumpster diving. But food banks have actually been stretched. Interesting. Plus, there's also Klarna. But they want a burrito. Food bank, isn't that like a bunch of canned beans and chicken noodle soup? Yeah, it is. It's a dog's dinner. Yeah. Wow. Interesting times.  Interesting times. I mean, I guess I hope I live to see it. It would be fun. Rolo? Sorry about that. Yeah, I just wanted to quickly chime in. Yeah, Battlefield 6 is not going to push back. the riots if uh if ebt doesn't work in the month of november which it seems like it won't and and like people don't know when it's gonna come back on i mean that's i was sort of thinking down now i mean i don't use ebt no well i don't even know how you get ebt  I was reading an article on it. If you qualify for it, legally, it's not just you're allowed to have it, but that's your right to have it. I think you just call the program that's in charge of it and you check off some boxes and they give it to you. um right you have to prove that you're impoverished i would imagine sure but i i don't know like you know how how rigorously they yeah i mean i i don't know yeah right um but i was thinking about it just now like in in ancient right maybe this isn't a good  Example, but in ancient Rome, they had graindle. And while the empire was still functioning, like even I think all the way up until when the Arabs invaded Byzantium, I guess in the Western Roman Empire, it ended a little bit sooner, but as long as they could like, you know, give the population free grain and, you know, the emperors could, you know, uh, win favor that way and stuff like that and then once the arabs took over they had the grain dole cut off and that was kind of like it wasn't the only factor but that was when uh political factors kind of really started changing so i i mean it just makes me think once you if you can keep people fed like  this is what I was kind of trying to respond to. Like entertainment is fine, but entertainment is not going to keep your mind off of a grumbling belly. And especially if you can't feed loved ones or dependents or whatever. So yeah, I can imagine people would riot. Yeah. What are circuses without bread? right well bobby sands um successfully starved himself on a hunger strike okay but like who this is not the average this is not the person on ebt either like i'm just saying that people aren't quite the people of 1917 and maybe people are more akin to an animal that's given up on survival because we've fallen so low in terms of and our entertainment is just so all-consuming that maybe people just don't have it in them to bread riot i i don't i simply don't agree i mean like if there's anything that would awaken the animal within the the caged animal it's hunger in somebody yeah it's it's like have you not seen that you know you need to eat a snickers because you've turned into like  Godzilla or Betty White or something. What entertainment is good enough to make people stop thinking about food? We live in America. We've genetically engineered 400 pounds. people in electric scooters stuff like that what happens when they can't get their i would love to see them riot a scooter riot my god i'm here for that just like punching people with those you know like extension grab hands or something you can't get out of their chairs yeah i mean it's it's gonna be uh gnarly just violently attacking the fit basically like you come out of the gym or something and just these like scooters are headed towards you there's this one guy who's like he can't see his toes but he finally gets to use his ar-15 oh my god  I hope this happens. I have this sort of sadistic nihilistic urge to just see Americans become animals. I mean, I don't know. I'm just going to admit it. Just pop off.  My God, does Trump want this? Be his voters writing. Yeah, the day it's supposed to happen is, according to some guy on X, Millennial Capital, it's going to be on November the 1st. Wow. I think the longest day of the shutdown is 35 days.  That we've had before? Yes. Interesting. Did something like this happen? No. Okay. They kept EBT cards working? I mean, I didn't remember hearing about it, but there was always the risk of it. But if it goes long enough, there's going to be no federal funds. Now, obviously, states and churches and NGOs can step in.  People aren't going to starve, of course. But, you know, there's always cheap calories. It would just be like a minute for it to dry up. Wow. What is, ostensibly anyway, what is the reason for this shutdown? I mean, there's usually one... Argument about Medicare funding? Medicaid funding? It was Medicaid funding? Yeah. Yeah.  And so the Republicans want to cut it and Democrats want to keep it the same. And that's where we're at. Yes. Yeah. But again, the notion, is there something deeper afoot?  Is this the way? I mean, I sort of say this with a smile on my face, but again, I don't dismiss this notion that this is the way that Project 2025 gets enacted, is that they just shut the government and never really restart it. Or if they restart it in just some minuscule form, getting rid of the Department of Education, no more EBT, all this stuff. We'll keep the military, of course.  And, yeah. We'll just have VC-funded private schools and Catholic Harvey Mansfield University open. That'll be it. You can get pimped out by Peter Thiel. That's your only prospect.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if this if this. Yeah, if we if we're talking about this in Christmas, then I think this theory has a lot of plausibility. Do you think that maybe they could gin up support for Israel by offering a new EBT card in exchange for a pro-Israel post or something? That would be interesting. Yeah. Torjash credits every time you post. Musk was on stage with BB and then Yahoo was talking about And you have at the same time, Sam Altman setting up a world coin and all this, all these stable coins happening. The Atlantic Council is having their IMF World Bank week or whatever, where they're talking about a new Bretton Woods and it's all part of going direct. So I wouldn't be surprised if they, during the shutdown, they roll out. So sort of basically a private Fed now.  which FedNow is kind of the public. Why would they want to do that? Well, ostensibly they say they'll cut down on fraud so that they could track every transaction. Oh, so we would move off the dollar because cash is where fraud takes place. Isn't that right? You would know this regular guy. Not that you engage in fraud. You just seem to know these things.  I mean, yeah. Also Bitcoin. You can do fraud in numerous ways. I mean, credit cards are... There's a lot of credit card fraud. Yeah, but if you want to pay a hitman or buy drugs, you're using cash. Oh, of course. Or Monero. Yeah. I wouldn't know. So if everything is digital, everything is traceable. So we could have a stable coin. Makes sense.  it would be the right time to roll it out. Wow. We shall see. Um, let me, I'm getting a little tired here, but, uh, let me think if I had anything else. No, I think I've said all I, yeah, said all I want to say. Um,  All right, any last-minute questions? I mean, this could... I mean, I don't think... We're engaging in speculation, late-night speculation. I don't think any of this is really, like, out of bounds. I mean, something's happening in the world. There's something going on with this. Like, the kind of dramatic ice raids... the shutdown of the government and no one seems to care the just the stock market seeming to be balanced on a razor's edge really a lot of talk about 1929 and so on bitcoin going up and down like crazy yeah did bitcoin go back up  I think during the Russia, you know, this recent approach. Yeah. And we haven't even mentioned the fact that the CIA has been authorized to engage in lethal activity in Venezuela. We didn't even mention this. Yeah. Rubio is pushing for regime change, basically. Yeah. I would be very surprised if we didn't have something like COVID in terms of, you know, significance, not necessarily pandemic by the 2028 it could be a flu outbreak because everyone's anti-vax now so you're gonna have just massive amounts of contagious people well they talk about a cyber pandemic that that would probably be what does that mean though like you can't get on the internet anymore ricking your computer oh my god Well, the idea is I think you just hook everybody's iPhone up to Starlink because cell towers are down or something, or they do something with the electrical grid because there have been multiple intrusions from the Chinese and the Russians to shut down the power grid or 911 call centers. Wow. Wow.  It is worth pondering to the economic situation. I mean, it does feel like something could be around the corner because everything's at huge highs, like stock market at a big high. Inflation is higher than it was. Gold is at an all-time high. Inflation is higher than it was under Biden. Right. Bitcoin at all-time high. I mean, just housing is so high. Just everything's so high.  And I could envision quite a pullback at some point in the next year. Oh, yeah. Well, we'll see.  All right, guys. Let's just put a bookmark in it here. And I actually wanted to talk a little bit about conference and stuff. No, Homer is not Sunday. Hamlet is on Sunday. But I will talk to you guys about that soon. I might send out some messages. All right, guys. I will talk to you soon. All right. Good night. Bye-bye. Ciao.

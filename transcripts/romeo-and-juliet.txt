OK, so. The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. 1597 written, of course, by William Shakespeare. There is a myth in the casual sense of that word, that Shakespeare invented all of these plots, maybe with the exception of some historical plays like the tragedy of Julius Caesar, Anthony and Cleopatra, et cetera. And then he invented Romeo and Juliet. The fact is one of the things that allowed him to be such a tremendously prolific writer was that he was a man who used source material. The source material here, the major source material is the Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke from a few decades earlier, 1562. That was actually an epic poem.  Shakespeare is clearly drawing from it. He's clearly choosing something that also resonated with his audience. Many of the people there would have been at least passively or somewhat familiar with this work. Much like I saw some previews for Withering Heights with Margot Robbie, and I think it's probably similar to that in the sense that the vast majority of the people will not have read it, but they will have...  heard of it. Other sources include Ovid. Ovid is an ancient figure who, along with Plutarch, is extremely important for Shakespeare. This is someone he's read and studied. In the Metamorphoses, there is the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, that is very similar to Romeo and Juliet, and that is two children and their families hate one another, and they're talking to each other through through a hole in the wall and they fall in love and so on. Interestingly, the names Romeo and Juliet, or excuse me, Montague and Capulet,  Those apparently first appeared in Dante's Purgatorio. And I have this little snippet here. Come and see you who are negligent, Montagues and Capulets, Manaldi and Filippesci, one lot already grieving the other in fear. So Dante is allowing the reader to gaze upon families in Purgatory. There's no indication in... uh purgatorio that these are warring tribes that hat hats fields and the mccoys uh instead the implication is that these are families that have gone decadent and they are uh sent to limbo in order to purge their sins before uh ascending into heaven I will say, though, it might be Arthur Brooke or it appears to be Arthur Brooke that's taking those names from Dante. Correct. Yeah, he's using Capulet. And so that's not Shakespeare's innovation.  Correct. Yes. Again, there are some passages in Shakespeare that are directly drawn from Plutarch. I'm thinking here of Anthony and Cleopatra, where it would be considered plagiarism in the modern day. We should remember that Shakespeare was a working artist who was  Desperately searching for source material. He obviously was a producer as well. And this was a commercial enterprise, the Globe Theater, in which he wanted to make money and write things that were popular and then publish the text later on. um and uh so that that is um he he is finding source material that would be at least somewhat known by his audience and they would they would you know bring many of those you know it's more similar it would seem to the kind of out of like an adaptation of a novel for film right i mean that's essentially what he's doing so i don't and i don't think it um  You know, I don't know what the copyright laws were then there if they existed at all. Right. Right. But I don't think I doubt that, though, I don't know. I mean, maybe there's some history behind this, but I would have to guess that Arthur Brookness, you know, to the extent that he was still alive, I guess it was 30 years prior, 35 years prior. Mm hmm.  It's a kind of – it seems like it's more of an homage than it's a plagiarism. Oh, absolutely. I'm using the word plagiarism advisably. He's continuing the guy's work, so it's not really – you would see a plagiarism. But I'm not studied in – uh shakespearean history so i'm simply saying this to get you know everything there are sources to what what shakespeare was doing he did not invent these things from whole cloth hamlet uh hamnet his son who died interestingly  Um, there is the Spanish tragedy by kid. There is a sort of Scandinavian omelette or something like this that is it is an older story. What I'm saying is that and I'm not saying this as a criticism of Shakespeare at all, but I think I'm just putting him into perspective. He would adapt things in the way that Stanley Kubrick would adapt a Stephen King novel. And he would continue it, honor it in many ways, but also transform it and make it into the greatest version that is actually remembered. But I just think all of this should be put into perspective. That's all I'm saying here. No, I agree. But it is valuable knowing this because it is not... So to the extent that the play also references... Pyramus and Thisbe, it would seem that Brook is the one who's making that, you know, he's the one who's taking inspiration from Ovid as opposed to Shakespeare. That's not to say that Shakespeare wasn't aware of the precedent in Ovid, but it does seem that Brook is the one who's, you know, the real innovator in terms of the kind of details of the story. But I don't think that that, you know, it's not like, and I've been listening also to Arthur Bloom, who's fascinating. Oh, Harold Bloom, you mean? Or Harold Bloom, I'm sorry, I'm getting confused with Arthur Brooke. Harold Bloom, so in his, you know, his analysis, which I think is similar to what you're saying, is that the thing that's remarkable about Shakespeare is not the plots, which, and he, the plots, he just, as you're saying, he took, and he took the plots from elsewhere. And, and I don't think, and it's not even a kind of mark against him. Like as you're, you're making the comparison with Kubrick, right? He's, he's developing the most refined and memorable version of a story that has been told that will then become immortal. You know, it's not a, as a consequence, it also makes Arthur Brooks work immortal. We're talking about Arthur Brooks because of Shakespeare, you could argue, right? So I don't think that there's any, but Harold Bloom's point is that the real innovation of Shakespeare is in the development of characters, the complexity of characters, and these characters that feel very real and authentic and that are multifaceted and complex and rich, and they're very distinct from one another. So he's developing...  different personalities in, you know, and they're almost self-aware in a way. I think that that's something I haven't read Harold Bloom for a little while, but they almost overhear themselves speak and then move on in a new direction. So they're, they're not cardboard cutouts and, You know, it's not a figure like the Jew of Malta and Christopher Marlowe, who's just a stock villain who's evil and delights in his evil. It's a character like Shylock, who's sort of vulnerable. and and you know wounded and so on i guess literally figuratively in the pound of flesh aspect of that play but they they sort of overhear themselves speak and and develop also which um i i do think is something new i mean that that book by that i i assume you you've been listening to on audible or something but harold bloom the invention of the human so he this this notion that we can be a complex, ambivalent personality that can be self-aware and develop and move forward, he attributes to Shakespeare. Yeah, he's implying that, or he's stating, that sort of the richness of human emotion and human personality is  is owed in some important part to Shakespeare, right? Yeah. And I think he might be overstating the case, but what I think, because he's a zealot when it comes to Shakespeare. He's just like, Shakespeare is fucking God, basically. Yes. He says that the only authors that are comparable are the authors of the Hebrew Bible. And, you know, you would expect maybe him to say that. And also, but I mean, that's, you know, that Hebrew Bible is a genius work, as we've said. Right, yeah. uh and also the gospels right so that those are the two things that come close to shakespeare right and uh and that hamlet the only figures that come close to hamlet is yahweh and jesus and so forth they're moses um so he's he's a zealot and he's and and that by itself is interesting that he is so concerned with promoting um shakespeare because i think that he sees some I think he sees a kind of, I would argue, from a sort of Jewish perspective, he sees a kind of moral world developed by Shakespeare that is also inhabitable by Jews, if that makes sense to you, right? That's interesting. I think that might be part of his sort of interest in what's developed with Shakespeare. But to get back to, and I'll return to that point, but to get back to the simpler point, I mean, on some level, you know, the title of his book, of course, is The Invention of the Human. Is that what it's called? It's  It's a very, you know, kind of over-the-top and dramatic suggestion. You know, Shakespeare, like, Yahweh created man from the dust, right? It's sort of what's being implied by what he's saying. But it also sort of rhymes with one of your key tenets, which is that life imitates art. That we were, in a way, as complex as we are now... with we wouldn't be as complex as we are now if we hadn't read shakespeare that reading hamlet makes us self-aware makes us sort of question things in a new way and you know through through kind of a i don't know what to say like almost osmosis like grand osmosis we're more complex figures because this man wrote these plays and yeah in a way in a way more civilized  And also in a way, though, you could argue more domesticated or tamed, right? I mean, that's a possible, and we can return to this discussion, but just to make, again, the simpler point, which I think you were already making, was that, yeah, it does rhyme with Aureum theory in the sense that he's arguing that life is imitating art. He mitigates this by saying Well, we can imagine that, you know, Juliet, for example, or you could take any of his characters is based on a real person that Shakespeare encountered. Right. In other words, Shakespeare is basing, you know, the models that everyone will imitate on things that he's imitating from, you know, personalities or people in his life.  presumably that he's encountered, right? Maybe his first love was something like Juliet, who knows, right? And so he mitigates it by saying that, right? So in other words, he's also, Shakespeare is a creator, but he's also a kind of, has a sort of role as an interpreter in a medium of reality itself, right? Of the real world. So his art is imitating life.  Right. And that in from that, it gains its sort of verisimilitude or its authentic quality or nature. So he admits that. So it's a kind of it's not it's not just a simple case of Shakespeare inventing people. And then people then imitate the people that Shakespeare has invented and so forth, which is the other other part of his thesis. But yeah, no, I think that he doesn't... I mean, in him, I don't think... I don't know if this would be a Berkness theory. We'll take a look at what he's doing, but I don't think that what Bloom is implying is that Shakespeare was a Jew. No, no, no. I think what he's saying, though, is that he's a kind of... The development, the way in which personalities...  developed according to his theory from Shakespeare. They developed in a kind of positive direction where, you know, people also became more humane in a manner, right? Became more complex, became, I would even say more tragic, more sensitive, I think is a good word to use. So people became more sensitive through,  a Shakespearean development of personalities. And I think that, so that goes back to my other point is that there's a kind of domestication or taming that's occurring because we are made more sensitive through this art of Shakespeare. We're made less barbaric and that creates a sort of more favorable environment for Jews, which would be a kind of subtext, which would be the perspective from which evidently Bloom is clearly coming. One remark he makes is that he thinks that Merchant of Venice is clearly anti-Semitic. But is it really? Merchant of Venice... for its time probably was progressive i would guess it's progressive vis-a-vis christopher marlowe the jew of malta is a hilarious play but you have this just wicked man basically  And again, yeah, I think you're right. I think it is overall anti-Semitic in the sense that almost all of humanity was anti-Semitic before like 1965 or something. But the way in which Shylock is a sympathetic figure, he is ultimately brought low. His daughter becomes a Christian. He's cocked in that way. And, you know, he's not triumphant. He doesn't get revenge. And all the Gentiles end up rich.  But, you know, their ships come in miraculously. But there's no doubt that, yeah, I see where you're going. I mean, there's no doubt that in creating this self-aware and ambivalent, sympathetic, flawed space, um person that he sort of is by moving off stock characters he is sort of like opening up a new world a new way of thinking about humanity in which yeah jews could inhabit i i think that's i think i i see where you're going yeah and the conversion it's i mean the covert the conversion of his daughter points to  the kind of inherent, uh, tolerance of Christianity. Um, and so the Jew is even redeemed through this, uh, conversion. So it's not, you know, and that is the inherent, um, both, uh, you know, filosemitism and tolerance of Christianity. Yes. Um, let me, so I'll, I'll just mention in passing because we'll come back to this of the, montague and capulet so again these are not names that shakespeare invented in rem theory naming convention is all important it's not the only thing but it can help us uh it can confirm and corroborate  symbols within the story and just the message of the overall story. And oftentimes a name can just be the key that unlocks the whole puzzle. It opens the door and now you see what's inside. I would.  Shakespeare clearly uses names sort of symbolically in a very obvious way. The suitor of. And again, this is also in Brooke as well. But the suitor of Juliet is Paris. We are we do think back to the Trojan War and the Iliad and. uh paris and the apple and helen and so on so there are some just there's another character named samson and so there there is a use of name right there but i i i would just say from my perspective and my reading of what i think shakespeare is doing i would be a little bit hesitant to say that naming conventions just affirm everything and  particularly here. Yeah, and it's almost a kind of more, and again, I'm not, just assume this is a kind of disclaimer throughout these discussions on Shakespeare. I'm not a Shakespearean scholar or expert. Richard knows much more about Shakespeare than I do. So I'm coming at this, I'm just approaching the text in a more  raw manner, you could say, which I think is fine. Sometimes that can be very valuable because you're throwing away other assumptions that people have already laden the text with. I would say, and again, there will be theories that we'll probably get to on this broadcast about  the nature of Shakespeare himself and maybe even his sort of ethnic character. And I have no reason just to state it plainly that he was Jewish or anything like this. I have no reason to believe that. But again, I haven't studied him in any deep way, so I'm not really in a position to make a sort of judgment like that. I'm a Stratforian. What? I believe Shakespeare was Shakespeare, yeah. Yeah, okay. I am blue-pilled.  on the Shakespeare question. I think he was a guy in Stratford who had a wife. Well, whether I would have reason to dispute that, I have no basis to dispute it. I don't have the scholarship to dispute it. So I'm just going to go with that. And that's kind of a sort of assumption that I have. But we're looking at him, nevertheless, as a symbolist. I mean, he still can be a symbolist.  without being, you know, without being either an Aryan symbolist or a Jewish symbolist. And I would class, for example, Wagner as a kind of, you know, sort of imperfectly practicing aim. Yes. Robert E. Howard and so forth. So I wouldn't,  I have no reason right now to put Shakespeare in that cap, for example. I think Shakespeare is a Christian theorist, a symbolist, and that's what I will get to eventually. So it is a subset of Jem and it's Jem. And now if we want to claim him as an honorary Arian, we certainly can. But he is, and he is obviously, but he is doing something just a little bit different.  Yeah. But to your point, the name, some of the names like Tybalt means like, you know, it's like war leader or something like this. It has some name connected to violence or war. And that's clearly the character. That's Tybalt's character. And Ben, what's the other guy? Ben Volio. Ben Volio. Ben Volio.  Benvolio's name means like goodwill or something. Yeah. And he's a peacemaker. And so there's a kind of more innocuous symbolism going on with the names, it would seem. Right. Yes. Where he is. I mean, clearly Shakespeare is saying, OK, this is what the character represents. So I'm going to have a name that signifies what he represents. So we know that he's using names intelligently. He might be using them more kind of he may not be adding an ethnic layer. And he may be using them in a more innocuous way, but he's using them deliberately and intelligently. Anyway, so I'll let you. Yeah. Well, Chris, you raised your hand. Do you want to jump in real quick before I move forward?  Yeah, just one quick thing. I had to get away from something. I wanted to say something about Mark's comment on Harold Bloom, his suspicion that Bloom might like Shakespeare partly because he thinks that Shakespeare in sort of deepening or making more complex the Aryan character might make it more amenable to or perhaps malleable. From the Jewish perspective, it kind of is an interesting reversal of what Nietzsche acknowledged about the ancient Hebrews and how they affected the character of the Romans. He said, that the ancient Hebrews, through their slave morality, their religion, made Aryans more malleable, more amenable to Jewish influence, but it did have the virtue of also making Aryans more deeper, more complex, more sophisticated. So, yeah, Marx's idea or suspicion about Harold Bloom there is sort of the reverse of that. not more malleable i'm not sure it's a reverse of it i i see it as almost an analogy of it well i mean it's i'm saying the the arrow of causation is pointing in the opposite direction right oh i see right yeah it's not an area and that is shakespeare was was creating this i see that  Yeah, it's like, I mean, in the sense that it's not like more malleable there. I mean, I'm oversimplifying it. I agree. These things don't work in a simple unidirectional manner, but it's like rather than more malleable to Jews, therefore more sensitive, as with the ancient Hebrews, it's like more sensitive, therefore more malleable to Jews in the case of Shakespeare, perhaps what Bloom is going for. Yeah. Yeah, that might be a sort of unconscious. Here's a much more sort of simpler comparison to make the point. let's uh think of elvis right so elvis was a gentile right uh but he could dance like a black man and he could sing like a black man and that's what he wanted to do with his life right and so jews and i mean i think he there is actually a sort of there's a record in his childhood that he was an actual shabbos goyim that he was like turning off the turning off and on the lights for jews that lived in his apartment building or something like this but wow but  But he is, I mean, that's sort of the genius and brilliance of Elvis is his own. He ultimately does represent something like Bacchus or we might say Orpheus, but he represents this kind of bacchanal figure that Jews are able to say, Jews in the music industry and say, hey, well, that serves our interest. We like that guy because we're sort of like we want society to kind of go in the same direction that he's going in. And so I think that Bloom is implicitly, and he's probably signaling this to a Jewish audience, but he's promoting Shakespeare because he sees something valuable in its ability to, I would argue, affect the Gentile world in sort of a positive way from his perspective. And again, I mean, it's a sort of complex thing, as Chris was, you know, pointing out that the remark that Nietzsche makes is that in some ways we were deepened by Christianity, for example. In general, I think that we've been deepened by our interaction with Jews. I think that probably without Jews, we're not very deep at all, in fact. You know what I'm saying? And I think that, you know, that's not to like, you know, I don't want to take away too much credit for ourselves. It's not a question of our  our genius in science and our genius generally as a race, which is abundant, of course. But I think that there is a, because, and I've discussed this before, because Jews have a kind of interiorness, a sort of depth, you could argue, and a lot of this depth or interiorness has to do with the fact that they are concealing intention from us, right? Yeah. They see themselves engaged in a kind of combat with us, but it's a sub-Rosa combat where they have to use other means aside from combat to dominate us. whether it's, you know, finance or it's in what we discuss on this show is culture and art, right? Or religion. So they use that as their sort of will to power and as their sort of special, you know, it's sort of like the wizards against the warriors or, you know, swords versus sorcery and so forth, right? And so in that way, I think that they have  generally, whether through Christianity or otherwise, have made us deeper. And we definitely can say, of course, that Shakespeare, obviously, as all Europeans, was inflected by Christianity. in the ethos and morality of Christianity, inflects including, I would argue, this kind of a liberal aspect of Shakespeare, is a consequence of this ethos that ultimately has a kind of Jewish origin in Christianity, right? In any case, I'll let you continue. And maybe that seems like a kind of simplification, Because obviously you have a Jewish influence, and then you have the stimuli, and then you have the subject, which is the Aryan, the Gentile, who has his own innate tendencies and traits and so forth that are influenced by this religio-cultural impact of Jews, essentially. Anyway, so I'll let you continue. Yeah. So...  Let me just mention this. Montague and Capulets there. There is a literary origin for these. A person. That I mentioned before we started recording John Birkness. uh who seems to be working in in parallel with rim theory and has it's important to say reached the opposite conclusion about this play that i have reached uses naming convention in a very REM-like way, and he sees in Romeo Montague an evocation of Rome, which is, of course, fair enough, in the Montague Mountain, Montana, where I live, um the the seven hills of rome or or something like that juliet is going to be jehovah's child you hear jew right there in the beginning of the word uh capulet um think per capita decapitation it means head and it's also the origin of the word cap and so he is suggesting that it is the cap like the yarmulke kippa the um  this is a Jewish cap versus the Roman hill, and that they are combining. And he goes on to discuss the way in which there's a folklore tradition in the Kambala of Jews being the real descendants of Adam and all Gentiles, Esau, Rome, being the descendants of the serpent, and they need to be just eradicated. Um, and this is playing out in this sort of esoteric Kabbalist way in which, um, Shakespeare operates.  fascinating. I don't buy it. And it's sort of interesting that he goes in this direction because it sort of adumbrates the direction I want to go into. So you wanted to say something, Mark. Well, yeah. And also, I think his broader theory is based essentially on the study of the Talmud and of Kabbalah. And again, I think that what he's engaged in is legitimate, right? So he's teaching to us a perspective  emerging from the Talmud and Kabbalah, which I think is relevant as scholarship and is useful. But I think my theory about the Talmud though, is that it is ultimately a kind of lesser work and it includes both, maybe both the kind of misunderstanding of, and not a complete misunderstanding. I think that there is, you can read the Talmud and gain from the Talmud, especially if you're sort of reading between the lines,  But I think that there could be a kind of misunderstanding in its exegesis  of the Torah, at least in certain cases. And also, there could even be deliberate obfuscation in some cases in the Talmud as well. I think that the real way to analyze the Torah is to analyze it directly, including through an analysis of the Hebrew in a study of the story. So for example, Barkness's idea, which emerges from studying the Talmud, is that Adam is ultimately a kind of Jewish figure or sort of proto-Jew, and he's the father of the Jews and so forth. And that theory would make sense from a kind of chauvinist perspective, right? This idea that, well, man, mankind only, and this is an idea that people have  derived from the Talmud as well, though the language there is much less direct than this. But this idea that, you know, man, only Jews are men, right? And that we represent something less. And I actually think my reading of the Hebrew Bible is different, that Adam is akin to Edom. And this is reflected in the Hebrew and so forth. Adam, Edom, Esau, that they're all connected, especially through the symbolism to be red and so forth, and that ultimately these represent Arian figures or Gentile figures, and that Yahweh represents a kind of the Jewish collective or the archetypal Jew, Yahweh. And we can see this in the way in his relationship to Judah, who's at the head of the tribe of Israel's, and also in clues that are given essentially in the Hebrew Bible, where it seems that basically Judah is being identified with Yahweh and so forth. So we have a different sort of fundamental reading, I would say, of this part of Genesis. And my analysis is based more on a kind of direct interaction with the Torah. Now, look, I think that, again, I think what he's saying represents a kind of legitimate way of approaching the problem, but I think that ultimately it's incorrect. And I think that when you study art, contemporary gem, as we call it, you find corroboration from my worldview and my thesis, essentially. Yes. The other thing I just wanted to mention there, I mentioned this before we turned on the recorder, we lost all these gems, is that Shakespeare might very well have been an autodidact.  Well, he was an autodidact, clearly. And he read all over the place. He was reading Ovid and the Metamorphoses, which are a work that's evoked throughout history.  In fact, he also and he's reading more contemporary works, Arthur Brooks. He's he's reading the works of his his rival playwrights, people a little bit older than he was like Christopher Marlowe obviously influenced him and was brilliant, you know, in his own right. But also he was reading the Bible, so he would have read the Geneva Bible, which was a translation by Protestant reformers during the reign of Bloody Mary, in fact, while they were in Geneva. And Shakespeare, I mean, he lived through the publication of the King James Bible in 1611, I believe, when that was first published. But he would have read the Geneva Bible.  I don't want to bash Berkness here. He can certainly do his work, and maybe he's right. Who knows? But it seems much more likely that Shakespeare was reading the Torah in translation than Shakespeare was a Kabbalist, a sort of secret Kabbalist who parachuted into London and became a theater producer.  I mean, you just have to do more work to prove something like that. Then you have to prove that this remarkable man from Stratford read the Bible in translation and was deeply influenced by it. Okay. Does he talk about Brooke at all in his review? He doesn't.  Which is, I mean, isn't Brooke the Kabbalist, if the names are saying what he's implying? It's a very good point. He's almost assuming that Shakespeare invented this, which is something that we need to get away from. He neither invented the first names or the last names, though. Exactly. So, I mean, it seems like... Well, he sort of invented Romeo, because it was, was it Romeus, I believe? Yeah, Romeus. Yeah, I mean, it's not like... That's not necessarily the hole in his theory in the sense that he might also assume that Brooke is a Kabbalist, right? Yes. I'll let you continue. Okay. This is just something we can talk about in terms of what is Shakespearean tragedy, but what is tragedy in general? I want to put forward something that is...  Distinct from. Nietzsche, actually. And distinct from AC Bradley, I don't I'm certainly not rejecting their works here, but. I want to go in a little bit of a different direction in what Shakespeare is doing in terms of Chim. And I guess what I would describe as tragedy is reconciliation. So this is actually from A.C. Bradley's, maybe the most famous Shakespearean scholar. And this is very important in...  in many assumptions that people make about Shakespeare. The tragic hero of Shakespeare then need not be good, though generally he is good, quote unquote, and therefore at once wins sympathy in his error. But it is necessary that we should have so much of greatness that in his error and fall, we may be vividly conscious of the possibilities of human nature.  That kind of rhymes with what Bloom is saying. Hence, in the first place, a Shakespearean tragedy is never, like some miscalled tragedies, depressing. No one ever closes the book with the feeling that man is a poor, mean creature. He may be wretched and he may be awful, but he is not small. His lot may be heartrending and mysterious, but it is not contemptible.  The most confirmed of cynics ceases to be a cynic while he reads these plays. And with this greatness of the tragic hero, which is not always confined to him, is connected, secondly, what I venture to describe as the center of the tragic impression. The central feeling is the impression of waste. With Shakespeare, at any rate, the pity and fear which are stirred by the tragic story seem to unite with and even to merge in a profound sense of sadness and mystery, which is due to the impression of waste. What a piece of work is man, we cry, so much more beautiful and so much more terrible than we knew. Why should he be so if this beauty and greatness only tortures itself and throws itself away?  And so Bradley here is evoking Aristotle. You'll probably have heard the notion of pity and fear. And there's a sort of purging of that motion, that these emotions can... sort of lead to bad things if taken in excess and so you might go watch um oedipus rex and have this vivid feeling it's it very similar to the way in which you know horror movies are quite popular with women and females they they uh they might feel sort of scared in the world they're surrounded by men who are  You know, a different sex and they're bigger and stronger and you can sort of. Vividly live out vicariously a sense of horror and danger and and so on and kind of get that out of your system and in a way kind of master it. But with Shakespeare, we have something a little bit different in the sense that you see Hamlet, you know, how many plays could Hamlet have written? Hamlet might be the only character capable of writing Hamlet. He is so ingenious. And to see him descend into a death and the destruction of the kingdom of Denmark is just a massive waste. Romeo, very similar to Hamlet. And in his thoughtfulness, proneness to depression and so on, even Juliet is quite intelligent, but also very lusty and just a sort of wonderful girl who.  I guess you could say flawed. She's very robust. She wants Romeo to get in her bed right away. Let's consummate this thing. You know, at the very least, she has this instinct for health and fecundity and loyalty. And to see that wasted, to see her commit suicide, you are filled with pity and fear and a sense of  Uh, mystery. We seem to have, this is a very nice package passage here. Uh, we seem to have before us a type of the mystery of the whole world, the tragic fate, which extends far beyond the limits of tragedy everywhere from the crust rocks beneath our feet to the soul of men. We see power, intelligence, life, and glory, which astound us and seem to call for our worship. And everywhere we see them perishing, devouring one another and destroying themselves, often with dreadful pain, as though they came into being for no other end. It's almost evoking Schopenhauer or something here. Tragedy is the typical form of this mystery. Because that greatness of soul, which it exhibits, oppressed, conflicting, and destroyed, is the highest existence in our view. It forces the mystery upon us, and it makes us realize so vividly the worth of that which is wasted, that we cannot possibly seek comfort in the reflection that all is vanity.  I think I'll save this next quote. This is a very famous quote about Hamlet from Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy, and he presents Hamlet as a kind of Dionysian man who's able to see the cacophony of the world and multitudes and is nauseous because of it.  I don't doubt any of these things. I think A.C. Bradley is really getting at something. And I do think that that is one of the sources of enjoyment, if you want to use that word, about reading or watching Shakespeare. Yeah. And there's also no doubt, as we discussed before, that these characters just jump off the page. They seem to have a life of their own. They're self-conscious even. It's like an artificial general intelligence in the text itself. And when even that can commit suicide at age 13, if even that can be destroyed, uh everything will be destroyed you know mount everest will at some point crumble i mean there is some sort of profound i don't think the right word is pessimism exactly because it's a profound awe at this aspect of life that Shakespeare is getting at perhaps in a way that Euripides wasn't with his characters. I don't think we have that type of feeling, uh, uh, towards Pentheus, for instance, um, that we do towards Hamlet. And, and that's important. I would just, let's just read the prologue of, uh, Romeo and Juliet, because it is getting at something else that I will suggest is occurring in this play and also in Hamlet later on. So, Richard, Nietzsche also makes a criticism of Shakespeare. He compares him to Sophocles, and the line is, he says, Shakespeare is a mine of immeasurable wealth in gold-led  and rubble philosophically's was not merely gold but gold in its noblest form interesting  And it goes back. I think I made this remark. He also he favors Goethe to Shakespeare. And this, you know, I think he I think there's a little bit of nationalism going on here as well. Like he hated the English. Yeah. Yeah, he did. But he also hated the Germans simply as well. True. Yeah. Or he hated the common German. But, you know, Goethe, he he put in a different.  Goethe, he almost considered non-German because of his genius, right? But I think that nevertheless, there could be a little bit... But I think the point, though, and if the point... I mentioned this on another call, but I think that he found Goethe in Sophocles as kind of denser in genius. But this is kind of... I think it's also the problem that he may have encountered or related to the problem that he encountered when he attempted art himself is that art is not philosophy. Nietzsche, of course, is very dense. It's aphorisms and so forth. He himself is not  you can't compare Nietzsche to Shakespeare because Shakespeare is writing a play. He's not just having characters appear as Nietzsche attempted with his fictional works, just repeating sort of aphorisms and so forth and being essentially philosophers. He's writing a play about humans and he's writing a narrative, right? So it's a different art effectively. So you can't apply kind of the same  standards, as it were. Yeah. Yeah. Nietzsche is, at the end of the day, uncovering things. Whereas you might say that the artist is sort of covering things. Yeah. Okay. So... I mean, having said that, there are aphorisms in Shakespeare, and that's one of the things that we like about Shakespeare. Yeah. But I think that from Nietzsche's perspective, they could be more frequent, or at least as a comparison. And again, he's not panning Shakespeare. He's saying there's gold there, but amid lead and rubble. Yeah. Yeah.  So this is the famous chorus. This is the prologue to the play. Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life.  whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their death bury their parents strife. The fearful passage of their death marked love and the continuance of their parents rage, which, but their children's end not could remove is now the two hours traffic of our stage. The witch, if you with patient ears attend, what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. So, what? Did someone say something? Okay. I think maybe I'll mute whoever there. Okay.  I think there is a real attempt to reconcile things in this tragedy. The chorus or the prologue tells you what's going to happen. He sort of gives it away. Many of the audience would be familiar with this story before viewing it anyway. And he talks about these two houses, equal in dignity, ultimately reconciling through this tragedy. And so I guess what I would stress here, and I would even stress this with a far more like nihilistic play such as Hamlet, is that in these in Shakespeare's tragic mode, he is trying to reconcile opposites of some kind. Drama is born of strife.  So what do we have here? We have the Hatfields and the McCoys, two ruling houses, and these two teenage young people are just so desperately in love that they don't care anymore. They don't care about names. They are just sucked into the madness of love. and so on um but at the end of the tragedy there is a reconciliation at the end of hamlet ford and bra takes over denmark and that is actually in fact a good thing and he is a man of action who is who does properly revenge the death of his father and is due to his commanding nature the final line of hamlet is shoot his deadly commanding nature is no doubt going to be a better leader, but I'll talk about what I think the opposites going on in Hamlet are next week. But I would stress here that what Shakespeare is trying to reconcile is in effect, the sun and the moon and the,  The connection of Juliet with the sun is overwhelming. And I don't think there is ever a exception to this rule. The connection with Romeo is to darkness. the moon he actually swears by the moon and at one point he in fact is the serpent in the garden and that is the the most famous scene that we have here the uh the the balcony scene we can watch zeffirelli's version or i think we might want to read it together so we can kind of stop and and talk about these things and so it's white and dark and So I'm trying to summarize the theory here, and I think maybe you're sort of guessing where I'm going with this. But light and dark, the sun and the moon. Juliet is the sun. Romeo consistently depicted at night. Darkness, he seduces Juliet in the orchard, a very interesting evocation of the apple, and thus the Garden of Eden. He is reconciled through the philosophy of Friar Lawrence, who is able to talk people out of, say, suicide, who's able to use his knowledge of apothecary to bring these two people together, who has a plan at the very least to raise Juliet from the dead in the tomb.  And he is a Franciscan fire. This is St. Francis. Of course, at 12th and 13th century Italian monk, a humanitarian associated with nature. I think there are a lot of stories about him. I'm not sure I believe them, but a man who vowed to live in poverty. But the the true Christian, the and to and to antidote or antipode to decadent Catholicism is this earthy man who truly lives like Jesus and throws away, uh, the world. And so the true Christian is able to reconcile the sun and the moon, these two antipodal forces. And, um, the end, there is actually, uh, a line that is said by the Prince. So he is the sovereign. Um,  and he acts a lot like the chorus. The chorus comes back in the act two, doesn't come back again. A gloomy peace this morning with it brings. There's morning again, the sun rising the East. This is a very consistent evocation of Juliet. The sun for sorrow will not show his head.  So the sun is depressed and is not going, go hence to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo. The title is Romeo and Juliet. The final line is Juliet and her Romeo. So the sun might be depressed and that might not be rising, but there is a sense of joy.  The what is represented by Juliet Capulet is now encompassing Romeo. It's her Romeo. And I guess just to let the cat out of the bag here just a little bit. I do think that Shakespeare is an esoteric writer, and I do think that we can use the technique that Mark developed REM theory to analyze him. However, you never want to try to force someone into a Procrustian bed and come to some conclusion that this is gem and that Shakespeare's secretly Jewish or something like that. I don't believe that. I don't think that works. I don't think that fits. I think there's a sort of subset of gem, something that retains a great deal of Jewish esoteric moralization, which is Christian esoteric moralizations.  And he is trying to reconcile opposites. I'll talk next week about Protestantism, the man from Wittenberg, that doesn't give it away, and Catholicism in Hamlet. I think with Romeo and Juliet, he is reconciling the moon and the sun, the light and the dark. And I would suggest that... If we take the notion of the friar as the key that does this, that he's reconciling Jew and Christian. Romeo is the Montagues are an expression of the Old Testament of darkness and Judaism, and they're being sort of absorbed into the son of Juliet. And one of the ways I one of the ways that makes this play more compelling on an unconscious level much more so than if it were just simply two teenagers in love that their love goes astray and everyone's sad at the end. Both Romeo and Juliet are built as golden statues in Verona after this event. They're sort of both honored and reconciled, Old and New Testament, sun and moon. Um... Ultimately, this death ends the Hatfield versus McCoy relationship between the Capulets and Montagues. They're reconciled. So it's not just tragedy in the way that perhaps Nietzsche would see it or in the way that AC Bradley would see it in the sense that we look upon this and just it's just all a waste.  No, Shakespeare is trying to reconcile something. He's trying to bring opposites together. I think that's occurring with Catholicism and Protestantism in Hamlet. I think this is again. it's a bit of a stretch uh but if i i believe he is trying to do this with uh the old and new testament the nocturnal and the solar with romeo and julian and i'll have textual justification for that in a little bit but does anyone mark do you want to jump in or does anyone else want to have any have any questions on this or yeah no i just um  I mean, I think it does seem that there is comparison. She's also compared to the ocean at some point, too. Yes. and I think with the tears on her cheek and yeah yeah she's as abundant her love is as abundant as these are lines I think that she's delivering so her love is as abundant as the ocean yeah so it gives her a kind of an ocean symbolism it would seem as well and sorry I mean I think that what you're saying is correct that she's evidently associated with the sun now is it the case that Romeo through the language is associated with the moon and I'm i'm talking particularly through the language um i do see that i i and i've just pulled up the pdf and done a search on it uh so they and look for all the mentions of the moon you know moon could be referred to by other words of course but um uh and one one does not it seems he mentions the moon um  I don't know. This is why he mentions moonshine or moonshine is mentioned earlier. I don't know who's speaking it. But Romeo says the line.  and he's comparing her to the sun. So I think that that seems like clearly Shakespeare is intending that she's associated with the sun. I think that that is in there. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid  are far more fair than she. So it seems there that the moon is made both feminine and is not necessarily associated with, Romeo is not associating the moon with himself necessarily, right? And I think probably unlikely he's associating the moon with himself.  So I would just present that as a possible contrast. I think that the association with her with the sun is clear. And I think the fact that they're both cast in these golden statues at the end is interesting as well. Now, is Shakespeare making a solar reference with these golden statues?  That would be very sophisticated, in my view. And maybe that's what's going on. Or, you know, you could say in a kind of Jungian level, he's making this sort of solar connection with the golden statues. Or it's a kind of, you know, and again, I don't know how much that might be a detail that's taken from Arthur Brooke. I mean, it's something that we can look and discover, because it does seem like a lot of sort of important details are taken from Arthur Brooke. I don't know if that's among them. i don't think this consistent sun and moon poetic like layer is and and and that's you know again that's where i'm saying that that shakespeare is transforming source material um in a way that does operate on an esoteric level oh sure yeah yeah no and certainly not like  these references in the text. I don't know, actually. I'm not familiar with the earlier poem, which is an epic poem of some length, so there's details to the poem. In fact, I think even the phrase star-crossed lovers is in that original poem. So I think that I guess I would be looking for stronger textual evidence in the text that he's associated with the moon. You make the argument that he has a kind of nocturnal presence in the play, which I think that it seems like there certainly could be some evidence for that. I do think it is interesting and remarkable that he's associating her with the sun, And that does speak to a kind of pagan mindset that Shakespeare demonstrates here and certainly demonstrates in other plays, that he has an awareness of these older pagan symbols and religions very clearly. And so that he'll make references to them. I mean, sun worship is a kind of, this is something that goes out with Christianity effectively. So it is a kind of, there's something very deeply pagan about him making these references. It is one thing I would say, too, that I don't think I tend to doubt that this was sort of conscious in his mind. In fact, he may have been completely unfamiliar with Norse mythology, for example. But Norse mythology is interesting in that the sun as a symbol is sort of demoted. It doesn't have great significance.  And there's no important sun god in Norse mythology. There's this character Freyr, who is more of a kind of vegetation god that might even be more similar to Bacchus. But sometimes people associate him with the sun, but I don't think the connection there is strong. And Odin actually chooses mortals to, you know, to pilot the sun.  the chariots of both the sun and the moon, right? So it's a kind of, it's not given the elevated status that it is in the Greco-Roman pantheon, the symbol of the sun. And it's also, he gives, it's a female goddess, soul, that he gives the responsibility for being,  piloting the chariot. And I see something kind of even subversive in that, right? It's taking the most important role from a male deity and giving it to a female deity. So I see something kind of subversive in that, especially when contrasted with the Greco-Roman religion, right? Which I think that, and I do think that Norse mythology  as Christianity is kind of a response or a reaction to the Greco-Roman pantheon, right? It's aware of the Greco-Roman pantheon. And in fact, it's promoting characters like Hermes and Mercury esoterically through this figure of Odin. But so I would just point to that as a kind of interesting detail is that the son is not, if she is the son, there is even something kind of subversive in that. And I would say, you know, from Shakespeare's perspective, that's not, I don't think it's deliberate. You know what I mean? I think that, I think he's, he's obviously he's honoring this goddess, but, or who effectively becomes a goddess in his play, Julia. Yeah. Yeah.  But traditionally, you know, in the Greco-Roman, the sun is associated, it is male, right? Just as Zeus is the sky. I mean, he has a wife, rather, who's the queen of the sky. So there are other goddesses that have celestial aspects, but the sun in particular is male. It's either Helos or Apollo. And I think that that is...  it's meaningful because the symbol of the sun is so potent and powerful. We remember from the Homeric hymns, Zeus is afraid that Apollo is more powerful than he is, right? And then there's some evidence in the Homeric hymn that Apollo is in some way curved.  his power is curved because he is too powerful ultimately. And he has to be kind of domesticated or tamed on some level. Yeah. Anyways. Yeah. So those are just, you know, and yeah, to actually the sun goddess is in the far East within Shinto Shintoism, you know, interesting in the East. Generally, though, the moon,  The east is associated with moon worship. So Mesopotamia, everything east of Mesopotamia is associated with moon worship. And there we see the moon having a kind of dominant significance to the sun. So Nana is a god above Shemash.  Anyway, so I'll let you. Yeah, well, this is actually to the point. This is Act 3, Scene 2, Juliet. So this is right after the prince banishes Romeo for killing Tybalt, who is a cousin, I believe, of Juliet.  after Mercutio was murdered in this fight in Act III. And we go back to Juliet here alone. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards Phoebus' lodging. So that's an evocation of Apollo.  Such a wagoner as Phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately. Spread thy closed curtain, love performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen. Lovers can see to do their amorous rights by their own beauties, or if love be blind, it best agrees with night. Come, civil knight, thou sober-suited matron all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match. She wants to. Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. Hood my unmanned blood. Unmanned. Wow.  This is saucy material. I mean, it's all poetry, but wow. Baiting in my cheeks with the black mantle till strange love grow bold. Think true love acted simple, simple modesty. Come night, come Romeo, come thou day and night.  For thou will lie upon the wings of night, wither than new snow upon a raven's back.  So she's going to be snow and a raven, which is a very evocative image. Come, gentle knight. Come, loving, black-browed knight. Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars. And he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with knight and pay no worship to the garish sun. Yeah. Well, so there... yeah yeah i think night we'll have to put an x rating on this well night of course is associated is especially associated with sex and the activities of night right so that seems that that's the kind of exoteric point that's being made there the obvious exoteric point is that night means sex right  Yeah, no, it's interesting. And she's wanting to be overwhelmed. She talks about this in all these ways. And I think this is, again, this is not the culmination, but it's a sort of like ending of the sun. She's going to be just totally enveloped in Romeo. She's going to be like snow on a raven's back. She's talking about, you know, let's lead the chariot the other way towards the West so we can have this night of lovemaking. Yeah. um and uh also it's interesting that she even you know you would it it's almost like it's a typo but i don't think it is i think it's intentional that give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out in little stars so you would think that it's almost if romeo should die he should be cut into little pieces and become the stars  But she's evoking, maybe in this almost Freudian-like way, her own death. And she wants Romeo chopped into little pieces and made into stars so that all the world will worship the darkness. So you, you see this, like she's been totally pulled into his world and she not just wants to have sex with him to make her blood manned as it were. Uh, but she, she wants the world to become dark. I mean, it's,  Yeah. Amazing sun. She calls her own. I mean, she, Romeo sees her as this beautiful sun rising in the east, a sun that can light up a tomb because she's so beautiful and, and so on. She imagines the darkness overwhelming her and she calls and pay no worship to the garish sun. She's the garish to describe sun.  Oh, I have bought the mansion of a love but not possessed it. And though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them. Yeah, I mean. Robes and may not wear them. She's being covered in Romeo. It's what this is evoking. Go on. Yeah, no, I again, I would say that the clear kind of exoteric meaning is that the night is associated with sex and the activities. Yeah, sex and the day is associated with the innocence of not having sex. Essentially, you know, one thing that might be interesting for you to look at, too, is, you know, I would I think it would be useful. Is is there any is he associated with the moon, though, in particular?  Oh yeah, I can go there. Okay. I think it would be interesting in your research to look at medieval alchemy because there, yeah, in alchemy, the two-headed creature, most often depicted as the rebus or two-headed dragon, symbolizes the unification of opposites, male and female, sun and moon, or spirit and matter. So, I mean, he might be  He might be drawing on alchemic symbolism as well. But there, the sun is associated with the male, so he could be inverting it. Yes. Harold Bloom has the theory that he's bisexual, that Shakespeare is bisexual. I mean, does he say he would have to be to create a figure like Rosalind or something, or Juliet, or he has to know what it means to be feminine to write these women like this? Yeah, yeah. I mean, Harold is quite a gushing zealot when it comes to Shakespeare. Yeah. I think he might be going on his own sort of intellectual attraction to Shakespeare. Yeah. I don't think he's bisexual in the way that  We have that identity of someone who just, you know, for whom anything goes or whatever. I think he means bisexual in the way that I put it like he's he's so deep that there's almost like he knows what it feels like to be a woman.  He has empathy for his female characters, essentially. Yeah, he no doubt does. I mean, he's sort of a proto feminist, not in the sense that he is interested in voting rights or something like that, but just in the sense that he depicts the women as deep. I mean, there's just no question about it.  Maybe not quite Hamlet or something, but very complex and real and compelling. And the feminist critique is that he doesn't know how to write women, right? Just wrong. That's the feminist critique. Yeah.  I think it's actually the balcony scene, act two, scene two, where he swears by the moon. Let me find that. I'll find that eventually, but just to kind of further corroborate what I'm talking about here.  This is Act 1, Scene 5. Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright. This is when Romeo first sees... Juliet and he's of course forgotten all about Rosaline who he was in love with previously it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear beauty too rich for youth for earth too dear she shows a snowy dove trooping with crows  as yonder lady or her fellows shows. The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, and touching her, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now forswear at sight, for I never saw true beauty till this night. Let me... And yeah, and Harold Bloom talks about how...  Harold Bloom as well, as Shakespeare evidently does, venerates Juliet. It's something that is above everything else, right? Above Romeo. And so everyone else is sort of in comparison, a kind of mortal to Juliet. And that she's pure and her love is a kind of true and complete and unblemished love essentially. um you know and it's interesting too because uh bloom's i mean bloom comes off even though i think he was um you know he he was uh pilloried by feminists i i think the guy was hated by feminists but he is his his critique is somewhat feminist um my view you know it's not a um you know he's he He, I mean, it might even be the case that Bloom is sort of more in love than Juliet than Shakespeare is. I mean, that's the kind of loftiness with which he places this character is one that is innocent and perfect, essentially. And everyone else is sort of learning love from Juliet. I mean, I think that the other, you know, so he paints her as this sort of perfect, who's also kind of in her way wise. But I think that-  I think the thing is, though, we're also describing the love of a 13 year old. We're describing the love of young people, which is pure and is intense. Right. Oh, yeah. And it's much more intense than later love in life. Right. And so I think that that's really what Shakespeare is capturing. you know, love later in life is intense in other ways, but it's not, it doesn't have the same, I mean, it doesn't have the same, you know, life or death quality that like, if you're rejected, that you will kill yourself, or at least you will if you're a character in a Shakespearean play, you might just kill yourself, right? And it also from, with Romeo, it also, and I think that this might be something that Bloom is not really You know, he's under emphasizing is that what's really being described as youthful love and the stakes of youthful love and the craziness and in the sort of zealot aspect of youth love and also the kind of whimsical aspect of it as well, because. um romeo at the beginning of the play is in love with someone else and maybe maybe he's in as in love with that person as much as he will fall in love with juliet you know yeah but then he sees juliet he immediately forgets about this other girl right so it's kind of you know so how deep is his love  And really, how deep is her love? It's youthful love is what it is. I think that there is a kind of... I mean, it's poetically expressed. That certainly can be said. But how deep is it? Yeah, I think it does... You understand what I'm saying. Oh, yeah, I understand what you're saying, yeah. I think it's so poetically expressed that... So well expressed that it takes...  puppy love to a whole new level and you see the like almost evolutionary purpose in it  You know, I mean, those lines that I read from Juliet, I just think are amazing. And they are just so vivid. Her unmanned blood and all. I mean, she wants it, to put it mildly. And so it's sort of, it's not just like a teenager in love in high school and she gets dumped and is depressed. It's so well expressed that it just raises it to this...  level of like human existence. Yeah, I mean, from it's it's interesting from Bloom's perspective, she's almost because he sees her also is kind of sinless in a way. Yeah. And so in a way, he seems to present her as something opposite to Eve, for example, in the garden.  Right. And this is Bloom's perspective. I actually don't think it's a totally correct reading of what's going on, because what Bloom also says is that and I'm not exactly sure how he derives this, but he I think he derives it because there is a contrast between the two families. But they're considered it said it's sort of plainly stated in the play that they're of equal dignity. So, yes, noble families of equal status ostensibly. but there might be an insinuation that uh at least the capulets have more of a um a and even the name may suggest it the name meaning head or chief right so they may be the leading family even if by subtle degrees but they have more kind of social currency they're having parties and they're more social and so forth whereas the uh you know uh Of the two, they're less plain, you could say, even if officially they're of similar wealth or whatever the case may be. I'm not exactly sure how Bloom derives this, but he sees Juliet is marrying down.  Right. But this is a kind of thesis that, you know, I mean, and he and that actually and this is a kind of subversive aspect, I would argue, to what he's articulating in his in his critique of Shakespeare is that he's saying that, like, he says, well, women.  are moral and this is in in more moral than men and in a way kind of more divine or more wise. This is how Bloom is basically presenting it in his analysis and Shakespeare teaches us this. Right. But one of the ways in which Shakespeare teaches us this is that  They're marrying down, right? And he uses the example of Juliet, right? And they have to marry down because they're superior to us, right? I like Harold Bloom, but I just don't see it that way.  She might very well be marrying down. I agree with that. But I feel Juliet, what's fascinating about Juliet is that she's not an ingenue. What's fascinating about her is that she's hot-blooded.  Sure, and also- In a way that's almost shocking. I mean- And not necessarily innocent, right? Exactly. Whether she's marrying down or not, and marrying down we could see as a kind of dysgenic, that itself could be understood as a crime. In this case, it seems like it would be a hard, it might be a tenuous argument to make in this case because it's unclear that the families are unequal. But regardless, she's creating a problem by marrying against this hated house.  Right. Yeah. She's creating a problem. So she is not innocent on some level. Right. It is. He is a forbidden fruit.  Right. I mean, that's very obvious. He is a forbidden fruit. So Bloom's Bloom has this kind of like rose tinted analysis where he's just like, well, she's you know, what Shakespeare teaches us is the complete innocence of Juliet. So there is something subversive about what the guy is developing in. Yeah. You know how to read Shakespeare, how you read Shakespeare is that Juliet is completely innocent and everyone else is like way beneath her.  And but she part of her innocence is that she's marrying beneath herself. She's marrying down. Interesting. And that's part of her benevolence in divine, you know, or in character. I mean, I don't know how we call a. A 13 year old wise, but that seems to be implied in what he's saying. And maybe she's wise in a platonic sense, in the sense that good is a synonym of wise and so forth. You know what I mean? Mm hmm.  But in any case, that's Bloom's whole thing. So he does have like it's I think that, again, going back and I don't know how much of this was captured or got clipped. So maybe it's worth reciting some of it again. But yeah, I mean, he's I anyways, forget it. Well, maybe it got clipped. Maybe it didn't. But I'll let you jump in. well um do you want to uh does anyone want to read um do we have any does anyone want to read with me I mean we could watch a clip of it done I think it might be more helpful to read it um  Lucian, you're the only female. Do you want to read Juliette? Oh, there's Alicia here. Okay, good. Sorry, I was looking for RFH, but there's Alicia. That's me, yes. You want to read Juliette? Do you have a book with you? No, I don't, actually. You didn't do the reading, apparently. We could do this a la Shakespeare, just have two male actors do the reading. That's true. Chris, are you volunteering? You know, I will point out also, it was an interesting convention in like, while we're on the topic of gender bending, it was an interesting convention in like the 19th century that both Romeo and Juliet at that time were typically played by women. And it was thought that a woman was best suited. There are like some scenes where like,  Romeo is castigated for like his womanish affections and being like so into Juliet. It's like, hey, guy, get with it. You're acting like a woman. And it was thought that like a woman was actually best suited to playing the sort of young man. I like the female, you know, it's like, you know, in that, in like the musical Peter Pan, I guess it's sung, it's a female actress plays Peter Pan.  And I'm sure there are other cases of that, but that's just the one that comes to mind. But I think it sort of works. It's a juvenile character. And I think this Romeo and Juliet is more powerful if they're 13. If you have someone who's 30 pretending to be a high schooler, I don't think it really works. Well, it worked in Clueless, but that's rather less powerful. yes okay uh can you call up acts just type into your computer axine uh act two scene two alicia i knew you could read it to me yes okay act two scene two yeah so i'm gonna start just a little bit uh before that because there's some interesting here um interesting things here Um, oh, I already read this of, oh, she does teach the, uh, she does teach the torches to burn bright. It seems she hangs up on the cheek of night as a rich jewel in Ethiopia's ear. Um, okay. If I profane with my unworthiest hand, this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this my lips to blushing pilgrims ready. Stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. Um, okay good pilgrim okay but let's um that's when they that's when they first meet i was just introducing um okay so this is axine uh okay this is actually what i wanted to do first so this is before juliet enters it's the balcony scene is act two scene two yeah but like where in sorry where does it start in here  It starts right at act scene. Oh. Yeah. I'm just basically setting this up with some of the language here. So this is actually act two, scene one. Romeo, can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back dull earth and find thy center out. um and it's interesting just a little bit further here mercutio has some interesting lines about cupid um but this is benvolio and mercutio they have a dialogue um  Act 2, scene 1, line 34. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night. Humorous had a different resonance in the 16th and 17th century, the humors. Humorous night, blind is his love and best befits the dark.  Again, constant connection between Romeo and night and darkness. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark, nor will he sit under a meadler tree and wishes mistis were that kind of fruit. It's an evocation of the vulva, actually.  There's a lot of vagina references in Shakespeare. Country matters being the most notorious. But what I find interesting is the choice here. First off, it's at night. Secondly, it's an orchard. And thirdly, Romeo is sneaking into the orchard to meet Juliet. So there... If we want to associate this with the Bible, I think we would associate it with Genesis 2 and the Garden of Eden scene and the apple. And here, I don't think Romeo is Adam. I think Romeo is much more similar to the snake.  And I think that gives this whole scene a different quality of light and dark. You have a Venus character in Juliet, but also, you know, as we've established, constantly associated with the sun and solar worship. Then you have this dark figure climbing the fence, climbing a tree, sneaking into the garden. and so it's a sort of i mean i guess one way you could take this is almost this like romanticization dramatization of uh the the um tree of knowledge of good and evil in um in genesis and this is the love affair between the serpent and uh eve and later on uh juliet will directly associate uh romeo with serpent so i i do think that this was resonating in shakespeare's mind when he wrote it now these are very evocative points they can sort of lead us in different directions but let's just read this so we get a sense of what's happening here so are you ready  I believe so. You're just starting from the top of that scene? Correct. Start from the top. Yeah. Action. He jests at scars that never felt a wound, but soft. What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.  Be, uh, be not her maid since she is envious. Her vest delivery is, but sick and green and none, but fools do wear it. Cast it off.  It is my lady. Oh, it is my love. Oh, that she knew she were. She speaks, yet says nothing. What of that? Her eye discourses. I will answer it. I'm too bold. It is not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, having some business to entreat her eyes, to twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night.  So how she so how she leans her cheek upon her hand. Oh, that I wore a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek. I me. O speak again, bright angel, for thou art as glorious to this night being over my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white, upturned, wondrous eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy, puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air. O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name, or if thou wilt not but  Be but sworn, my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet. Shall I hear more? Shall I speak at this?  It is but thy name that is my enemy, thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's a Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face. Oh, be some other name belonging to a man. What's in a name? Any other part? Do you have a different, is that a different edition? Maybe. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, Folger Shakespeare.  Yeah, that's interesting. In the Arden, it is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part. It has a little body evocation. Yeah, that's interesting. Nor any other part belonging to a man. So we sort of know what she's thinking of there.  I take thee at thy word. Call me but love and I'll be new baptized. Again, I don't... There's so many, Shakespeare's words, words, words, there's words all over the place, there's puns all over the place. I get it, but don't you think that this metaphor was chosen and that it might corroborate what I'm suggesting, that Romeo is the Jew? Yeah, henceforth, I will never be Romeo.  What men art, though, that thus be screened in night, so stumblest on my counsel? By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word. My ears... Sorry, I know I'm kind of pushing things, but this is how I read this play.  No, I see it more and more, actually. Yeah, and the author of The Merchant of Venice. This is not alien to Shakespeare. Right. Yeah. My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? Neither, fair maid, if either thee disliked.  How camest thou hither? Tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, and the place death, considering who thou art, if any of my kinsmen find thee here. With love's light wings did I overperch these walls, for stony limits cannot hold love out. And what love can do that dares love attempt? Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.  If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords. Look, thou be sweet, and I am proof against their enmity. I would not for the world they saw thee hear. I have knight's cloak to hide me from their eyes.  And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of love. By whose direction foundst thou out this place?  by love that first did prompt me to inquire. He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot yet worth out as far as that vast shore, uh, washed with the farthest sea. I should adventure for such merchandise.  Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face. Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek. For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form. Fain deny what I have spoke. But farewell, compliment. Doust thou love me? I know thou wilt say aye. And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearest...  thou mayest prove false at lovers' perjuries. They say, sorry, Jove? Yeah, Jove. At lovers' perjuries, they say Jove laughs. Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, if thou does love, pronounce it faithfully, or if thou thinkest I am too quickly one, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, so thou wilt woo, but else not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, and therefore thou mayest think my...  Have your light, but trust me, gentlemen, I'll prove more true.  more true than those that have more coying to be strange. Cunning. Oh, it says coying here in mine. That's fascinating, yeah. Cunning to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, but that thou overheardst ere I was where my true love passion therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark knight hath so discovered.  Yeah, the dark knight discovered. I mean, he has this, it's this reversal. It's fascinating. Lady, by yonder blessed moon, I vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops. Oh, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, the monthly changes in her circled orb, lest thy, that thy love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by? Do not swear at all, or if thou wilt, swear by the gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and I'll believe thee. Yes. I think we take a little break here. I think there's an also interesting reversal in Shakespeare of associating Romeo with the moon. And so he is swearing by the moon. And... and she doesn't quite like that because it's kind of fickle and so it's it's interesting of you know the moon and the monthly cycle of menstruation for a woman is something you would it's like a more obvious choice if he were simply if shakespeare simply talking about male and female would be that she would be the moon as in constant as the moon  You know, but she's not. She's the sun and he's the moon. He makes it like a deliberate choice here. And so I think it's what she's saying. And then she wants to swear by he should swear by himself and that he is the God of my idolatry. Yeah.  You know, perhaps again, I'm using my thesis to almost like read too much in the lines. But if you do accept what I'm saying as a kind of unconscious or not unconscious, underlying current to the play, that she's discovering this new God in Romeo as a God of the nocturnal and night. And she's now worshiping him, the God of the Old Testament. Again, if we continue this metaphor. I mean, is it possible that it amounts to kind of a de facto gem as opposed to a deliberate gem? Is that, you know what I mean? So in other words, Shakespeare had this idea that effectively Romeo represents something nocturnal or phonic and Juliet represents something also innocent, I would say, right? Diurnal and innocent.  And he represents something less innocent, effectively. This is demonstrated through the use, right? I mean, so maybe that's a possibility. But you say that Berkness considers Juliet a Jewish, though? Or is that what he's implying?  Yes. This is why. So I mentioned, you know, like an hour or so ago. What's his name? It's CJB, but it's it's Berkness. And he's done this Kabbalistic reading. Yes, he associate. I mean, he says some interesting things here of. the the sun and the moon so you you almost you know obviously the moon is kind of like a parasitic entity if we want to say that it the moon is shines because of the sun the sun's on the other side of the earth um illuminating the moon and light is reflected yeah reflection yeah and needless to say shakespeare people understood this the this was actually understood in the ancient world as well and it's you know um it's a metaphor um  Um, and, uh, so he sort of gets at that. Like, there's almost like an implied cosmology in Shakespeare here that I think just makes this so evocative, where, um, the, you know, her new idol is being... if we extend the metaphor like her new idol this new god romeo is being illuminated by herself as in that she's the sun and it's fascinating but burkness makes the very strong claim using naming conventions that romeo is rome the uh montague mountain hills of rome juliet jew capulet cap kippa yarmulke so it's the christian and uh or the roman and the jew  In a battle and the Jew wants to exterminate the Roman. I just I think this is interesting. I just think it's simply wrong. Yeah, but he's also aware. So it doesn't it seemed like he may not have read as deeply into the text of the poem of the play itself.  Because I think he's aware of this sort of lunar solar significance. I'm pretty sure he's aware of that, where Aryans have a solar significance. And I mean, that's in the Talmud. So I assume he's aware of it. So he may not have just read the play itself and looked at the metaphors in the play and was more focused on i mean i think he got tripped up by naming conventions it's it's just so easy to claim that juliet is a jew because of her name just yeah to state the obvious kind of x which i mean i i assume that thesis is out there but that it's somehow a metaphor of rome and julius caesar right the tragedy because julius caesar actually was killed by rome and and it's the end of the roman republic and it's the beginning of the empire and so forth now exactly you know how that illusion works you know in in that illusion to the extent we would have to assume that that illusion to the extent that it is intended at all was intended by um was it arthur brooke the writer of the poem yes brooke yeah so it was intended by arthur brooke um  that metaphor would have been intended by Arthur Brooke. Perhaps. Yes. Yeah. You know, Yeah, and perhaps Shakespeare, we'll have to go, I'll have to, I've not read Arthur Brooks' epic poem, I'll admit that. But if I were to write an essay proving this thesis, then I certainly would. And it would be interesting if Shakespeare even reverses some of the metaphors that he found in the source material. um or or just create maybe the sun and moon metaphor just it does not appear in the source material this is just how shakespeare saw it um i'm getting at the notion that romeo is jewish from two directions first off this would not be unusual the merchant venice has written a few years or maybe even like two years earlier than this play  So he's aware of these things. I'm also using this from my interpretation of Hamlet that we'll get to later. Don't worry, Hamlet is not Jewish. But what I'm getting at is that in Shakespearean tragedy, quote unquote, there's this attempt to reconcile opposites into a kind of Christian worldview. Yeah. And so Romeo and Juliet is tragic and it's fine if you attend a performance and cry or something, but it's not really tragic. Like what's sort of interesting in Shakespeare Even in Macbeth, which is his most nihilistic play, and we can go into Macbeth later on, but there's an evocation of Christ, who is not from woman born, an immaculate conception, ultimately establishing hegemony over Scotland.  So Shakespeare's it's a happy ending. He's trying to reconcile these two things. So I'm taking a little bit of an interpretive leap.  which I admit, in stressing the Jewish quality of Romeo. But I'm taking that leap because I see it in other plays, Catholicism and Protestantism vividly in Hamlet. And what I'm suggesting is that these two houses equal in dignity are the two testaments that are sort of both being gold-laden at the end and propped up as a definitive Christian worldview. Well, we would also say, according to your reading, we would also say, and I guess this is the opposite of Birkney's reading, is that Romeo represents Satan on some level as well, to the extent that we understand Satan is also the serpent in the garden, which is at least the Christian interpretation of  But I think it is a pretty sound, you know, correlation that Christians have made. So. So it could so in that wouldn't that also doesn't. that doesn't fly against your thesis necessarily that he's he could also be satan and jewish of course and yeah you know that would kind of conform to a more medieval christian view is that satan is also somehow a jew as well right yeah um because yeah exactly their father is satan right according to the um or or you know the that's a that's a sort of shallow reading of those passages but um  certain Jews who say they are Jews but are not really Jews, their father is Satan, right? But it could conform with a kind of Christian anti-Semitism.  Exactly. That would have, that Shakespeare would have been steeped in. This actually goes to act. This is act three, scene two, line 70. This is right after Mercutio has been murdered. And then Romeo kills Tybalt and the nurse relays this news to Juliet. And she,  So, oh, this is Juliet. Oh, God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? Nurse. It did, it did. Alas, the day it did. Juliet. Oh, serpent heart, hid with a flowering face. Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? beautiful tyrant, fiend, angelical, dove feathered, Raven, wolfish, ravening lamb, despise substance of divinest show just opposite to what thou justly seemest a dam and a damned saint and honorable villain. Oh, nature. What has thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend and mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?  So she's reacting to the death of her cousin in an understandable manner. She's outraged. And so she goes into the, you know, I guess you could even say typical medieval anti-Semitic quality of what a serpent, what dragon you are that lives in this cave. But she can't get away from the fact that she loves him.  And she wants to be enveloped by him. And so he becomes a damned saint, an honorable villain. So again, the tragedy is the reconciliation of Christian and Jew, sun and moon, day and night, et cetera. It's my thesis. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. It is interesting.  It could be, again, it could be your argument is that it's Chem. Yes. And I mean, obviously he's a conscious symbolist and obviously he's conscious of symbolism, whether biblical or pagan symbolism. But I mean, the reading that he is a Jew, though, possibly is a kind of de facto gem. I don't know. You know what I mean? But I do think this goes to our earlier discussion, which I think that may have been deleted, right? So because we started recording after we had had about a half hour conversation. That Bloom, I think that Bloom, well, let's, I mean, we can actually revisit. I actually don't want to. I don't think all this was deleted. We sort of, I think we reiterated a lot of these ideas.  Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, should we... Yeah, I'm done. I think I've established what I wanted to establish. So does anyone have any questions or pushback? Are there Birkenes partisans in the audience? All right.  So we went a little bit over, but then I messed up by not recording the first 30 minutes. So there it is. But yeah, I really enjoy this. I think this is a, you know, interesting way to use REM theory in a different manner. Kind of take the lens, but adjust the lens a little bit and then look at other figures. So I hope you enjoyed it.  Yeah, definitely. All right. Well, I will talk to you guys soon. Bye-bye. Bye.

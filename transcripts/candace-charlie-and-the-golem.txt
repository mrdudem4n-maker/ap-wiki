It is worth retelling the Candace Owens origin story, which is just bizarre. And I'll be brief here, but she did first come on the scene. I know everyone fixates on this and maybe blows that out of proportion. You know, it's like saying that Richard Spencer was once a snowboarder in the mid 1990s or something.  you know, he listened to Green Day during that period and we've got to fixate on this. But anyway, she was creating this doxing website that was seemingly a mechanical Turk in which you would put in someone's mean tweet or Facebook comment and it would spit out his home address, which even the left, at least at that point, was like, whoa, obviously that could be misused for violent acts.  So that's where she was coming from. And the left criticized her for that. And then she sort of ran into the arms of Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, who was very influential at this point. And she was sort of the...  Ex-Democrat Blexit kind of thing of like, I left the left and or did the left leave me? They've gone crazy. She was a pioneer on that sort of anti-woke crusade of I don't even understand the Democrats anymore and Republicans just eating it up, loving it.  And so she started out in that area. And I, and I don't know how conspiratorial she would get, but you're talking with Alex Jones, just guilt by association right there. Then she goes to the daily wire and she has this friendship with Charlie Kirk, which also from the video she posted seemed genuine, a weird friendship between a, a gay Mormon and, and a Jamaican woman. It's, it's a true love. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that, but, um, She becomes this kind of neocon and this attempt by Ben Shapiro and others to put her up as a golem or as a mouthpiece, as the black young face of the establishment. And then she marries this very strange individual named George Farmer, former CEO of Parler, who is deeply connected with TPUSA, TPUK.  A Catholic Anglo Catholic aristocrat of some kind. And this is just my theory. But he seems to be putting all of these ideas in her head. It strikes me as a kind of bride of Frankenstein situation.  where you have this curious American Black woman who sort of can't be criticized. She can't be called racist. She can't be called reactionary or a Catholic traditionalist or an aristocrat. And you start putting all these ideas in her mind, the Frankist.  you know, the Ksar theory of the Jews, they're not really Jews and other things. Hitler was OK when he kept it within Germany, which in some ways is even worse than like promoting Hitler overall, because what he did internally was crack down on on Jews and put them into camp. So anyway,  She seems to be fed these ideas. And then she gets kicked out of the Daily Wire. She goes after Israel in a powerful and genuine manner. I'll just be fair here. And then now she has this show, which is the number one YouTube show for politics and culture. She's blowing away CNN. She's blowing away...  Maybe even Joe Rogan? I don't know. She's very popular. And I listened to about 15 minutes of it. It was like I was back in Monroe, Louisiana with the friends of my grandmother. It's just these gossipy women at the beauty parlor.  just sort of talking about nothing and insinuating. Like, that pastor, well, he says that he's doing good, but is he really doing good? Like, I don't know about this pastor. Like, just this insinuation of all sorts of things. And she's...  no doubt maintained the audience of Alex Jones types. But I think she's expanded her audience in two suburban white women in an Oprah Winfrey like fashion.  of this is our black lady. These white women in the suburbs, they love it when black women just talk, talk, talk, talk. They just can't get enough of that. And she's just a rip-roaring success. She's sort of unstoppable. I think she's completely batty and insane, but I'm not her audience anymore.  So anyway, that was a way of just setting up the whole thing. Absolutely. Beautiful description of the history. I've come to like her in the last few days. I've been critical of hers because precisely of what you mentioned, you cannot do good journalism and mix it in with 99% crap conspiracy theories. You can't talk about the trap door under Charlie Kirk while also seriously raising serious question of will the investigation be properly done on potential political links to Israel with Tyler Robinson. The thing is the mix of it removes credibility. The mix of it  And her handling of evidence is weak. Sometimes it is misinterpretation of evidence. Sometimes it is misinterpretation of sentences. But you have to give it to her, though. She has waited up to October 6th to publish her strongest evidence. And I believe she's playing numbers here. I believe she has so much poison in her heart. She has so much poison in her heart, she wants to throw the message to Israel, I'm going to miss your October 7th celebration. I'm going to miss it with facts. Interesting. Now, you have to imagine how much restraint it takes for someone who wants popularity, who has the greatest show on YouTube, to be withholding that evidence, which I was frustrated by. But yesterday, I understood it all. She wanted to hit Israel in the testicles.  Yes. She did it. She did it in such a poisonous way that a man like mine cannot even conceive of this kind of dirty warmongering. I mean, there were even co-hosts of Tim Cast's Sour Patch Lids crying almost on her Twitter saying, I can't believe she does that the day the 1,200 Jews died. Unbelievable.  Well, 1,200 Jews cried on October 7th, 2025. That is true. Let's listen to this. And then there's actually another shoe to drop. I don't know if you've seen this, but TPUSA responded. So I'll play that as well. But this is almost three minutes. She doesn't quite get to the point, but she has a rambling style that's very popular with Shelly. who lives in a suburb of dallas texas but rob in particular knew for an absolute fact that charlie was done with israel bullying him that's what bothers me so much about this man him allowing these headlines charlie's pastor speaks out you know crushes candace because of what she said not not whatever i don't like it he knew  and others knew that Charlie was done with Israel bullying him. And I am now going to present you proof of what I am saying. This is an actual group chat, which happened two days before Charlie Kirk was assassinated. There were nine people in total on this chat.  including Charlie and Rob McCoy. I'm going to protect the names of the other seven for now. To be clear, I might actually release a name every day this week. But I want to show you this because suffice it to two sets. This is like literally the Batman Halloween where  Well, the long Halloween in the Batman comics. She says, I might release one name of them every day for seven days. Seven as well. She's playing with Jewish teams, October 7th, the Seven Candles. She's into some wicked stuff. This is witchery of the highest level. This is witchery with a million viewers on YouTube. Yes, until they reveal the identity of the Batman. I mean, she will continue. It's... rob mccoy was on this text thread and i think it helps contextualize him as a person in my view that he would attack me for telling the truth about the pressure that he was facing take a look so charlie writes in this group chat just lost another huge jewish donor uh two million a year because we won't cancel tucker i'm thinking of inviting candace somebody writes oh  Charlie writes, Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause. And somebody writes, Sedona writes, please do not invite Candace. That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term. In my opinion, like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions. That nasty free will thing that God bestowed on us makes life frustrating at times after the dust settles a bit, maybe.  So again, this is 48 hours before Charles was assassinated. He was very clear and he was very... That nasty free will thing that allows us to criticize Israel on occasion. Let me read these again here. Because...  I think it is important to dive in. There is much in there. Just lost another huge Jewish donor. Two million a year because we won't cancel Tucker. Interesting. I'm thinking of inviting Candace. So that almost seems like he's being aggressive or something now. He's like, oh, well, I'm going to invite...  Yeah, like if you do this, I'm going further. They said, ugh, Jewish donors play into all the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this. Leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause. Just the stereotype comment here is fascinating because he's saying, he's making the realization that anyone on the so-called far right would have, which is, I try to extend discussion with these Jews. They come at me with cognitively dissonant talking points. They...  They seem to lie to my face. They seem to cancel me. Every time I see a Jew, it's for, you know, adding a piece written about me. Every time I see a Christian, it's to buy beef and eggs from his farm. And he has realized when I interact with Jews, it's different. Yes. Do you think he might have been sarcastic when he said leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause?  I think the sarcasm is possible, but I don't think it's not my main explanation. When he says this, what I think he means is he wouldn't even want to be against Israel. And in fact, leaving the pro-Israel cause doesn't mean going after Israel. Doesn't mean entering the anti-Israel cause. Right. Yes. I think that what's going on in his mind when he says this, and I've been reflecting about this yesterday. Here's what goes on. He is being bullied. He does not want to be under extortion. Therefore, he has to withdraw from the extortion, withdraw from the bullying. But he is receiving money from people who expect him to submit himself to bullying. And so in his moral mind,  He says, I cannot continue selling myself. I cannot continue accepting your money because you expect a service from me that I cannot deliver. Therefore, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause because you are sending me money on which you have expectations that I cannot deliver on. And therefore, it's a deceptive relationship. I cannot do the deceptive market. That is what he means. It's actually no comment about Israel so much, but the impossibility that has been created for him to continue in the economic relationship as it stands. A couple of things here. First off,  This doesn't paint Charlie in a good light, even if you are anti-Zionist. Because it's striking how, at least ostensibly, like at first glance, how mercenary he is. Could someone have given him $2 million a year and he's going to be... uh pro nambla or something or or or he's gonna be a vegetarian activist i mean i i don't know it is a weird light in which he's painted now this is such a short snippet you could certainly find text messages of mine that make me look completely horrible and i wouldn't want to be just judged on that one instance the other thing that that comes to mind is you know in some ways  Charlie Kirk is being self-aware, but not fully. What I mean by this is that Charlie Kirk is a kind of Goldilocks figure. He's not too bright, but not too dumb, just right. He's not too handsome, but not really that ugly. He's just right. And he's not too charismatic, but not uncharismatic.  Just right. That's who he is. He has no education outside of high school. And during recess or when other kids were playing sports, he was listening to Rush Limbaugh. know he's kind of as someone put it like skinny fat he doesn't work out or play sports because he's just constantly podcasting or constantly reading the news or talking to someone in the conservative movement cause and so he's a golem like charlie i don't want you to be assassinated but  The kind of deification that we have seen over the past two weeks is absurd. He's not terribly interesting. I mean, is he that brave? OK, but we forget how many like millions of dollars were put behind his campus tours. You know, it's not like he was just going out on under some beach in California, hopping on a soapbox and talking about Jesus. He was doing highly choreographed, well-funded junkets basically at these colleges.  So I'm not quite sure how brave he is. And it's like he's a golem. I'll just be brutally frank here. And I'm painting with too broad a stroke. He's a golem of the Jews.  who became self-aware at some point, but not fully self-aware. Charlie, I get it, but you're just some dude working middle management at Target. If you hadn't been somewhat haphazardly randomly chosen by the Jews... I mean, it's too broad a brush, but if the Jews hadn't decided that you were going to be their golem during the Trump era, like that's why you exist. You're not great. You're not terribly interesting, to be frank.  You're good at fundraising and pressing the flesh. I'll give you that. But your flesh was pressed by them mostly. Like you were chosen as their mascot for the football game that's going on. And you seem to have some illusion that like you're playing the game. Like he's like in a tiger costume by the grandstands going like, you know, go team, go team. And he seems to believe that he's the quarterback.  You're not the quarterback. You're a golem. You're a mascot that they created for their purposes for electioneering and winning over the crowd. That's who you are. Exactly. And he doesn't seem to be aware of that. He's high in his own supply. He believes his own nonsense.  Now, this is the other thing I'm using the Gollum metaphor. The end of the Gollum story is that they shut down the Gollum. And that is what Candace Owens is implying. And to be honest, it does sort of fit the script now.  Does that mean Israel killed him? I'm not at all ready to say that, but it is interesting how there is that little embedded story. They invent this goofy, cute, fairly intelligent little white boy mascot for the Republican Party and Israel, and then he gets shut down. That's the script, and it sort of fits, but... Absolutely, and everything you say there is exactly why it's a massively plausible explanation to think that there may have been Israeli terrorists getting rid of him because he's a golem, because he's nothing, and because if he's nothing, he's not worth keeping alive, and yet by staying alive, he may become someone. One thing I've learned interacting with Jewish power, with my own interactions with Jeff Epstein,  They hate it when you promote yourself instead of the institution you're building. Because the institution is available to take over. You are not available to take over. And you may drift toward an anti-Israel stance later, but the institution, they want to keep it for themselves.  And I've been denying myself some funding from Jeff Epstein at some point. I remember sitting in New York in a cafe with his assistant, and she was like, Jeff is alarmed at the fact that you self-promote too much. We want you to promote NeuroTV as a philosophical show. We don't want you to put...  the philosophers and the neuroscientists forward. We want you to put the show forward so eventually we can take it. That was the kind of underlying message. And I said, you know what? Back then it was 2014.  I said it's 2014. The social media is developing such that it's all about individuals and how much trust they gain with the audience. The future is without institution. The future is without CBS, ABC News. And you will only have men that you can count on your team or not on your team. And if the condition of Jeff for giving me more money for my show is that I have to put this aside, I'm not doing it. I'm going to write on my own. So in a way, I've done my own Charlie Kirk moment in 2014. Charlie Kirk did it in that Telegram message where he said even more explicitly than I did then, I'm going to have to give up the pro-Israel cause. Thank God I didn't get shot. but definitely it has changed my relationship with Jeff Epstein at that moment when I said these words. I know this is self-serving of me to say, and I'm aware of that, but just go with it. I obviously engage in self-promotion. Now, I also...  collab with people whom I respect and I learn from. We disagree. We, you know, move, move thought forward, et cetera. Like, I'm a very willing conversation partner, but I am obviously self-promoting. And I obviously think for myself, the thing that people hate is that I'm contrarian or he's a liberal or whatever, whatever. All that means is that I'm not on the team.  And I do feel like I am more of a threat because of that than other people. And again, I'm not just engaging in self-flattery here. There are people in Charlie Kirk's orbit. I remember the Blake Neff character who was in Charlie Kirk's orbit who got sort of mini-canceled...  in 2018-ish for going on chat forums and being Hitler-y, basically. And all of those people have, in a way, said things that are more outrageous or said things that are equally outrageous that I've said on a larger platform. you know, like MLK was a sex fiend and, you know, the, which I don't even bother talking about it. I think that's irrelevant. Maybe he was such a good activist precisely because his libido was so large. That's probably the argument that I would make. But anyway, or we shouldn't have done the civil rights act. Did you know that 13% of the population commit 50% of the credit, et cetera. They've done all of those things, all that sort of like basic bitch work.  alt-right 2015 level stuff they've all done. The difference is they're all sort of interchangeable nerds, cogs in the GOP MAGA machine. And so they're operating on behalf of the team. I'm not.  I don't want the team to win. So I'm like, I'm an open enemy of them. But they can sort of get away with it. And that's why we're in this like bizarre place where they won't talk to you, me. They won't. Nick Fuentes, they'll sort of footsie under the table a little bit more, but they won't talk to him, and I don't think they will, precisely because he is his own person who can go north, he can go south, he can go east and he's west. Not that he's random, it's that...  He can think for himself. He possesses that ability. And they don't like that. They want to trot out 1350 when the group hive mind decides that that's the time to trot this out. And they want to pull it back in when they're endorsing Herschel Walker for Senate or whatever the hell they're doing.  So if you don't operate in their little hive, they hate you. They think you're anathema. You have cooties. They think you're a radical extremist. Even though I would... suggest that just based on the level of superficial salaciousness, the conservative movement is more right wing than I am or you are. Like if you want to get just like crude racism or like personal attacks against AOC or whatever, you should go there. You shouldn't subscribe to me. You're not going to get that stuff from me.  So, you know, ostensibly superficially, they are more like lunatic than I am. Yet I'm the lunatic in their mind. It's just a very interesting phenomenon that's worth dwelling upon.  Yeah, I think there's been a huge split in the last 10 years of cognitive freedom. And there's just a bunch of people who have, and it's probably the default social mode of humanity to reject black sheeps. And, you know, you have these whole stories of scientists getting thrown down.  the roofs and people being eliminated just because they were ahead of their time. And yeah, they really don't like free thought. They will all pause for it. They will all say a couple of lip service to free market of IDs. But in reality, there's very few people that truly have the pursuit of free thought for individuals away from any social pressure. Not many people are made of that cloth.  I agree. I'm just going to play one more thing here. This is a brief one. This actually is confirmation that this text message is in fact real, which I certainly questioned. That weird like Dairy Queen photo that Candace released that had Superman paraphernalia. Superman came out in July and it was a Tyler Robinson. I don't know what to say, but this has at least been confirmed by someone whose interest it might be to reject it and claim that it's lies. So that's very interesting, but I'll just play this. But I want to take the start of this show to address some of the things that have been going around on public, namely about a text, a group text chain that has been made known and released by Candace Owens. And I just want to address it head on because, you know, that was a text grab, a screen grab that I had shared.  with people. So it is authentic. And I want to go into it because I actually am really excited that the truth is out there. I first want to say the reason I didn't share that screen grab publicly is because it was a private exchange. And I felt like it didn't necessarily comport with things that were already public. I wanted to not betray my friend's trust in that way.  But I did share it with some people in government because it happened really quick. It took 33 hours for authorities to get their suspect. And in those first moments, we wanted no stone unturned. We wanted to leave nothing unturned. So I shared it with a few people. Don't know where it went from there, apparently. But here we are. So one of the reasons, Blake, that I'm glad to have this now public It was not mine to share publicly, but one of the criticisms we've received is that we don't... It's like the least charismatic man ever. Anyway, it's very interesting because what he's suggesting... is that he gave those things to the government, I would presume the FBI, who were investigating the case. And I don't know, maybe he even himself had some questions. That's curious that he would give them that screenshot, because otherwise that screenshot is unresponsive, irrelevant to Charlie Kirk's assassination. Maybe he gave him a whole bunch of screenshots over the past week or something. Who knows? But what he's suggesting is that  that someone in the government gave that to Candace Owens. So Candace Owens was not in that discussion. So there's a leaker at the FBI, which is sort of fascinating.  That is one thing that's fascinating. Another thing that's fascinating with this segment is they are less interested at getting to the public truth than Candace is. It's very clear that Candace wants to push for these to be known. They're kind of uncomfortable about it. They're happy it did happen, but they wouldn't have... So TPUSA, it's still on the fence to me whether there are internal forces within TPUSA that wouldn't want the truth to be found. And that is kind of worrying in and of itself. Also, I would note there may be some degree of laundering of action here. Where someone who has committed something kind of wrong or kind of unethical is trying to wash it away by a small comment. And here you mentioned that, yes, he says eventually, I gave it to the government. But the first sentence that he says, he says, I may have given it to a couple of people.  Now, that to me, there is a difference here. Yes, you did give it to the government after Charlie Kirk was murdered, but did you share those screenshots or are you aware that some people in that group chat exchanged those screenshots before the death of Charlie Kirk? And given the laundering type of talk that he does, I may have given it to some people and then eventually confirmed, well, I gave it to some people in the government. I think there may be a larger umbrella of people who knew about this discussion.  And there's also people are pointing out Josh Hammer today. Josh Hammer tweeted a very bizarre tweet between the moment this telegram conversation happened and the killing of Charlie Kirk. He went to an old Donald Trump tweet from 12 years ago that was talking about public executions, and he tweeted, based. Now, people are saying this is in line with Irina, the murder of Irina, and perhaps he was calling for public executions of the murder of Irina. But it's very, very weird to me that he's talking about public executions all of a sudden on his Twitter account.  after having seen Charlie Kirk detaching from the pro-Israel cause. So what I'm wondering here is, will there be proper police work in finding the extent to which this conversation has spread before the murder of Charlie Kirk?  because there are organizational people who may have had financial interests. There are even people who may not be directly related to Israeli interests, may have seen this as a foreboding of perhaps them losing their jobs within TPUSA, perhaps them losing funding, losing opportunities. So there is a large umbrella of hypotheses that rise from  the disclosure of Candace Owens, which doesn't seem to put TPUSA in much comfort. That was a good catch.
